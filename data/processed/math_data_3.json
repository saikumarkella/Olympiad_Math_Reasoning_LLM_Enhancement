Note that if we represent the scenario in this manner, we can think of picking a <math>1<\/math> for one factor and then a <math>5<\/math> for another factor to form their product - this is similar thinking to when we have the factorized form of a polynomial. Unfortunately this is not quite accurate to the problem because we can reach the same product in many ways: for example for <math>n=2<\/math>, <math>4<\/math> can be reached by picking <math>1<\/math> and <math>4<\/math> or <math>2<\/math> and <math>2<\/math>. However, this form gives us insights that will be useful later in the problem.\n\nNote that there are only <math>3<\/math> primes in the set <math>\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}<\/math>: <math>2,3,<\/math> and <math>5<\/math>. Thus if we're forming the product of possible values of a dice roll, the product has to be written in the form <math>2^h \\cdot 3^i \\cdot 5^j<\/math> (the choice of variables will become clear later), for integer nonnegative values <math>h,i,j<\/math>. So now the problem boils down to how many distinct triplets <math>(h,i,j)<\/math> can be formed by taking the product of <math>n<\/math> dice values. \n\nWe start our work on representing <math>j<\/math>: the powers of <math>5<\/math>, because it is the simplest in this scenario because there is only one factor of <math>5<\/math> in the set. Because of this, having <math>j<\/math> fives in our prime factorization of the product is equivalent to picking <math>j<\/math> factors from the polynomial <math>(1+\\dots + 6) \\cdots<\/math> and choosing each factor to be a <math>5<\/math>. Now that we've selected <math>j<\/math> factors, there are <math>n-j<\/math> factors remaining to choose our powers of <math>3<\/math> and <math>2<\/math>. \n\nSuppose our prime factorization of this product contains <math>i<\/math> powers of <math>3<\/math>. These powers of <math>3<\/math> can either come from a <math>3<\/math> factor or a <math>6<\/math> factor, but since both <math>3<\/math> and <math>6<\/math> contain only one power of <math>3<\/math>, this means that a product with <math>i<\/math> powers of <math>3<\/math> corresponds directly to picking <math>i<\/math> factors from the polynomial, each of which is either <math>3<\/math> or <math>6<\/math> (but this distinction doesn't matter when we consider only the powers of <math>3<\/math>. \n\nNow we can reframe the problem again. Our method will be as follows: Suppose we choose an arbitrary pair <math>(i,j)<\/math> that match the requirements, corresponding to the number of <math>3<\/math>'s and the number of <math>5<\/math>'s our product will have. Then how many different <math>h<\/math> values for the powers of <math>2<\/math> are possible?\n\nIn the <math>i+j<\/math> factors we have already chosen, we obviously can't have any factors of <math>2<\/math> in the <math>j<\/math> factors with <math>5<\/math>. However, we can have a factor of <math>2<\/math> pairing with factors of <math>3<\/math>, if we choose a <math>6<\/math>. The maximal possible power of <math>2<\/math> in these <math>i<\/math> factors is thus <math>2^i<\/math>, which occurs when we pick every factor to be <math>6<\/math>. \n\nWe now have <math>n-i-j<\/math> factors remaining, and we want to allocate these to solely powers of <math>2<\/math>. For each of these factors, we can choose either a <math>1,2,<\/math> or <math>4<\/math>. Therefore the maximal power of <math>2<\/math> achieved in these factors is when we pick <math>4<\/math> for all of them, which is equivalent to <math>2^{2\\cdot (n-i-j)}<\/math>.\n\nNow if we multiply this across the total <math>n<\/math> factors (or <math>n<\/math> dice) we have a total of <math>2^{2n-2i-2j} \\cdot 2^i = 2^{2n-i-2j}<\/math>, which is the maximal power of <math>2<\/math> attainable in the product for a pair <math>(i,j)<\/math>. Now note that every power of <math>2<\/math> below this power is attainable: we can simply just take away a power of <math>2<\/math> from an existing factor by dividing by <math>2<\/math>. Therefore the powers of <math>2<\/math>, and thus the <math>h<\/math> value ranges from <math>h=0<\/math> to <math>h=2n-i-2j<\/math>, so there are a total of <math>2n+1-i-2j<\/math> distinct values for <math>h<\/math> for a given pair <math>(i,j)<\/math>. \n\nNow to find the total number of distinct triplets, we must sum this across all possible <math>i<\/math>s and <math>j<\/math>s. Lets take note of our restrictions on <math>i,j<\/math>: the only restriction is that <math>i+j \\leq n<\/math>, since we're picking factors from <math>n<\/math> dice.\n\n<cmath> \\sum_{i+j\\leq n}^{} 2n+1-i-2j = \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} 2n+1 - \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j<\/cmath>\n\nWe start by calculating the first term. <math>2n+1<\/math> is constant, so we just need to find out how many pairs there are such that <math>i+j \\leq n<\/math>. Set <math>i<\/math> to <math>0<\/math>: <math>j<\/math> can range from <math>0<\/math> to <math>n<\/math>, then set <math>i<\/math> to <math>1<\/math>: <math>j<\/math> can range from <math>0<\/math> to <math>n-1<\/math>, etc. The total number of pairs is thus <math>n+1+n+n-1+\\dots+1 = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}<\/math>. Therefore the left summation evaluates to <cmath>\\frac{(2n+1)(n+1)(n+2)}{2}<\/cmath>\n\nNow we calculate <math>\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j<\/math>. This simplifies to <math>\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i + 2 \\cdot \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} j<\/math>. Note that because <math>i+j = n<\/math> is symmetric with respect to <math>i,j<\/math>, the sum of <math>i<\/math> in all of the pairs will be equal to the sum of <math>j<\/math> in all of the pairs. Thus this is equal to calculating <math>3 \\cdot \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i<\/math>.\n\nIn the pairs, <math>i=1<\/math> appears for <math>j<\/math> ranging between <math>0<\/math> and <math>n-1<\/math> so the sum here is <math>1 \\cdot (n)<\/math>. Similarly <math>i=2<\/math> appears for <math>j<\/math> ranging from <math>0<\/math> to <math>n-2<\/math>, so the sum is <math>2 \\cdot (n-1)<\/math>. If we continue the pattern, the sum overall is <math>(n)+2 \\cdot (n-1) + 3 \\cdot (n-2) + \\dots + (n) \\cdot 1<\/math>. We can rearrange this as <math>((n)+(n-1)+ \\dots + 1) + ((n-1)+(n-2)+ \\dots + 1)+ ((n-2)+(n-3)+ \\dots + 1) + \\dots + 1)<\/math>\n\n<cmath> = \\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2} + \\frac{(n-1)(n)}{2}+ \\dots + 1<\/cmath>\n\nWe can write this in easier terms as <math>\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{(k)(k+1)}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2+k<\/math>\n<cmath>=\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot( \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2 + \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k)<\/cmath>\n<cmath>= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot ( \\frac{(n)(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + \\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2})<\/cmath>\n<cmath>= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot ( \\frac{(n)(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + \\frac{3n(n+1)}{6}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+4)}{6}<\/cmath>\n<cmath> = \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}<\/cmath>\n\nWe multiply this by <math>3<\/math> to obtain that <cmath>\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j = \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{2}<\/cmath>\n\nThus our final answer for the number of distinct triplets <math>(h,i,j)<\/math> is:\n<cmath>\\sum_{i+j\\leq n}^{} 2n+1-i-2j = \\frac{(2n+1)(n+1)(n+2)}{2} - \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{2}<\/cmath>\n<cmath> = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \\cdot (2n+1-n) = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \\cdot (n+1)<\/cmath>\n<cmath> = \\frac{(n+1)^2(n+2)}{2}<\/cmath>\n\nNow most of the work is done. We set this equal to <math>936<\/math> and prime factorize. <math>936 = 12 \\cdot 78 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13<\/math>, so <math>(n+1)^2(n+2) = 936 \\cdot 2 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13<\/math>. Clearly <math>13<\/math> cannot be anything squared and <math>2^4 \\cdot 3^2<\/math> is a perfect square, so <math>n+2 = 13<\/math> and <math>n = 11 = \\boxed{A}<\/math>\n\n\n\n~KingRavi\n","\nThe product can be written as \n<cmath>\n\\begin{align*}\n2^a 3^b 4^c 5^d 6^e\n& = 2^{a + 2c + e} 3^{b + e} 5^d .\n\\end{align*}\n<\/cmath>\n\nTherefore, we need to find the number of ordered tuples <math>\\left( a + 2c + e, b+e, d \\right)<\/math> where <math>a<\/math>, <math>b<\/math>, <math>c<\/math>, <math>d<\/math>, <math>e<\/math> are non-negative integers satisfying <math>a+b+c+d+e \\leq n<\/math>.\nWe denote this number as <math>f(n)<\/math>.\n\nDenote by <math>g \\left( k \\right)<\/math> the number of ordered tuples <math>\\left( a + 2c + e, b+e \\right)<\/math> where <math>\\left( a, b, c, e \\right) \\in \\Delta_k<\/math> with <math>\\Delta_k \\triangleq \\left\\{ (a,b,c,e) \\in \\Bbb Z_+^4: a+b+c+e \\leq k \\right\\}<\/math>.\n\nThus,\n<cmath>\n\\begin{align*}\nf \\left( n \\right)\n& = \\sum_{d = 0}^n g \\left( n - d \\right) \\\\\n& = \\sum_{k = 0}^n g \\left( k \\right)  .\n\\end{align*}\n<\/cmath>\n\nNext, we compute <math>g \\left( k \\right)<\/math>.\n\nDenote <math>i = b + e<\/math>.

Using the process of elimination, we can eliminate every option except for <math>\\textbf{(A)}<\/math> and <math>\\textbf{(C)}<\/math>. Clearly, <math>606<\/math> isn't prime, so the answer must be <math>\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }2^{607}-1}<\/math>.\n\nNote: A organization of computer scientist and mathematicians named Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) search for the worlds biggest prime numbers. More information can be found on https:\/\/www.mersenne.org\/primes\/\n","\nWe examine option E first. <math>2^{607}<\/math> has a units digit of <math>8<\/math> (Taking the units digit of the first few powers of two gives a pattern of <math>2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6,\\cdots<\/math>) and <math>3^{607}<\/math> has a units digit of <math>7<\/math> (Taking the units digit of the first few powers of three gives a pattern of <math>3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1,\\cdots<\/math>). Adding <math>7<\/math> and <math>8<\/math> together, we get <math>15<\/math>, which is a multiple of <math>5<\/math>, meaning that <math>2^{607}+3^{607}<\/math> is divisible by 5.\n\nNext, we examine option D. We take the first few powers of <math>2<\/math> added with <math>1<\/math>:\n<cmath>2^1+1=3<\/cmath>\n<cmath>2^2+1=5<\/cmath>\n<cmath>2^3+1=9<\/cmath>\n<cmath>2^4+1=17<\/cmath>\n<cmath>2^5+1=33<\/cmath>\n<cmath>2^6+1=65<\/cmath>\n<cmath>2^7+1=129<\/cmath>\n\nWe see that the odd powers of <math>2<\/math> added with 1 are multiples of three. If we continue this pattern, <math>2^{607}+1<\/math> will be divisible by <math>3<\/math>. (The reason why this pattern works: When you multiply <math>2 \\equiv2\\pmod{3}<\/math> by <math>2<\/math>, you obtain <math>4 \\equiv1 \\pmod{3}<\/math>. Multiplying by <math>2<\/math> again, we get <math>1\\cdot2\\equiv2 \\pmod{3}<\/math>. We see that in every cycle of two powers of <math>2<\/math>, it goes from <math>2 \\pmod{3}<\/math> to <math>1 \\pmod{3}<\/math> and back to <math>2 \\pmod{3}<\/math>.)\n\nNext, we examine option B. We see that <math>2^{606}<\/math> has a units of digits of <math>4<\/math> (Taking the units digit of the first few powers of two gives a pattern of <math>2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6,\\cdots<\/math>). Adding <math>1<\/math> to <math>4<\/math>, we get <math>5<\/math>. Since <math>2^{606}+1<\/math> has a units digit of <math>5<\/math>, it is divisible by <math>5<\/math>.\n\nLastly, we examine option A. Using the difference of cubes factorization <math>a^3-b^3=(a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)<\/math>, we have <math>2^{606}-1^3=(2^{202}-1)(2^{404}+2^{202}+1)<\/math>. Since <math>2^{404}+2^{202}+1\\equiv0\\pmod{3}<\/math> (Every term in the sequence is equivalent to <math>1\\pmod{3}<\/math>), <math>2^{606}-1<\/math> is divisible by <math>3<\/math>.\n\nSince we have eliminated every option except C, <math>\\boxed{\\text{(C)} \\hspace{0.1 in}2^{607}-1}<\/math> is not divisible by any prime less than <math>10<\/math>.\n\n~arjken (+ minor LaTeX edits ~TaeKim)\n","\nWe know that the prime numbers less than 10 are <math>2,3,5<\/math> and <math>7<\/math>. We can start by testing if any of the answer choices are divisible by <math>2<\/math>. We see that they are all sums of one even number and one odd number, which is simply odd. So, we cannot exclude any answer choices so far. Now, let's check divisibility by <math>3<\/math>. We can use the fact that <math>2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{3}<\/math> to our advantage: \n\n\n\n<math>(\\text{A})\\hspace{0.1in} 2^{606}-1<\/math>\n<math> \\equiv (-1)^{606} -1 <\/math>\n<math>\\equiv 1-1<\/math> \n<math>\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}<\/math> \n\n\n<math>(\\text{B}) \\hspace{0.1in} 2^{606}+1<\/math>\n<math> \\equiv (-1)^{606} +1<\/math>\n<math>\\equiv 1+1<\/math>\n<math>\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}<\/math>\n\n\n<math>(\\text{C})\\hspace{0.1in} 2^{607}-1<\/math>\n<math>\\equiv (-1)^{607} -1<\/math>\n<math>\\equiv -1 - 1<\/math>\n<math>\\equiv -2 \\pmod{3}<\/math> \n\n\n<math>(\\text{D})\\hspace{0.1in} 2^{607} +1 \\equiv (-1)^{607} +1 \\equiv -1+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}<\/math> \n\n\n<math>(\\text{E}) \\hspace{0.1in}  2^{607} + 3^{607} \\equiv 2^{607} \\equiv (-1)^{607} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{3}<\/math>\n\n\nSo, we eliminate choices A and D from divisibility by 3. Now, we move onto divisibility by 5. We can use cycling of powers to find useful remainders. Let's start with choice <math>B<\/math>. \n\n\n\n<math>(\\text{B}) \\hspace{0.1in} 2^{606}+1<\/math> \n\n\n\nWe see that the remainders of powers of <math>2<\/math> when divided by <math>5<\/math> cycle in a pattern: <math>2,4,3,1,2,4,3,1 \\dots<\/math>. Since the pattern cycles every 4 terms, we use modulo 4 to simplify 606, getting that <math>606 \\equiv 2\\pmod{4}<\/math>. So, we get that <math>2^{606}<\/math> is congruent modulo 5 to the second term of our pattern, so <math>2^{606} \\equiv{4} \\pmod{5}<\/math>. Thus, <math> 2^{606}+1 \\equiv 4+1 \\equiv 5\\equiv 0\\pmod{5}<\/math>. We now eliminate choice B and compare choices C and E.  \n\n\n<math>(\\text{E}) \\hspace{0.1in} 2^{607} + 3^{607}<\/math> \n\n\n\n\nLooking at choice E, we see that we have to do similar cycling for powers of <math>3<\/math>. We get a pattern of <math>3,4,2,1,3,4,2,1 \\dots<\/math>. Since this pattern also cycles every 4 terms, we use modulo 4 to simplify 607, getting that <math>607 \\equiv 3\\pmod{4}<\/math>. Both the power of 3 and the power of 2 have an exponent of 607, so we use the third term (since we just found that <math>607 \\equiv 3\\pmod{4}<\/math>) in each corresponding 4 term pattern to get that <math>2^{607} + 3^{607} \\equiv 3+2 \\equiv 5 \\equiv 0\\pmod{5}<\/math>.

This is because <cmath>7(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + \\cdots + 2^{2022}) \\geqslant 7S_{2023} = 1 + 2^{2023}a<\/cmath> which is <cmath>7(2^{2023}) - 7 \\geqslant 1 + 2^{2023}a<\/cmath> <cmath>(7-a) \\geqslant \\frac{8}{2^{2023}}<\/cmath> which only holds when a is less than 7 because the right is very small positive number, so the left must be positive, too. Clearly, a is also non-negative, because otherwise, <cmath>7S_{2023} = 1 + 2^{2023}a < 0<\/cmath> which would mean <cmath>S_{2023} < 0<\/cmath> which cannot happen, so a is greater than 0.  A similar explanation for b shows that b is an integer between 0 and 6 inclusive. \n\nGoing back to the solution, if our answer to the problem is n, then <cmath>16a - b = 7n<\/cmath> and <cmath>16a = 7n + b,<\/cmath> so we can try the five option choices and see which one, when multiplied by 7 and added to some whole number between 0 and 6 results in a multiple of 16. Trying all the option choices, we see that you need to add 7n to something more than 6 to equal a multiple of 16 other than for option A.

Now we calculate the area of the intersection of two hexagons.

The square have area <math>1<\/math>. Each of the triangles are 120-30-30, and hence its short side is <math>\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}<\/math> because its longer side is <math>1<\/math>.

We cut it in half and we're left with a quadrilateral with two sides with length one (because it shares these sides with one of the hexagons, and for this reason the angle between the two sides is <math>120<\/math> degrees) and one short side and one long side. Here, we divide the area even further. We draw a line that divide the quadrilateral into a triangle with side lengths <math>1<\/math>, <math>1<\/math>, and <math>\\sqrt{3}<\/math>(because it is 30-30-120) and another triangle with unknown side lengths. Simple angle chasing yields the triangle with unknown side lengths is a 15-75-90 triangle. If you remembered your sines and cosines, you know that <math>\\sin{15}=\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{4}<\/math> or you can calculate it by using the fact that <math>\\sin{15}=\\sin{45-30}<\/math>. Also, <math>\\sin{75}=\\frac{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}{4}<\/math>. Now, because the 15-75-90 triangle have one side with length <math>\\sqrt{3}<\/math>(it shares the side with the other triangle) and it corresponds to the 75 degrees angle, we have \n<math>\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}{4}}=\\frac{x}{\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{4}}<\/math>\n<math>\\implies x=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}{(\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2})}}{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}=2\\sqrt{3}-3<\/math>\n\nwhere <math>x<\/math> denote the shorter leg of the 15-75-90 triangle. Hence, that triangle have area <math>\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} x=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(2\\sqrt{3}-3)=\\frac{6-3\\sqrt{3}}{2}<\/math>. The isosceles 120-30-30 triangle obviously have area <math>\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}<\/math>, and that gives a total of <math>\\frac{12-5\\sqrt{3}}{4}<\/math>. We multiply that by <math>2<\/math> because <math>\\frac{12-5\\sqrt{3}}{4}<\/math> is only half of the intersection of the hexagons. We multiply the result by <math>4<\/math> because there are <math>4<\/math> pairs of adjacent hexagons. That gives <math>24-10\\sqrt{3}<\/math>, which is it for Case 2. \n\nNow that we got the total area of the intersection of two hexagons, we find the area of the intersection of three hexagons. Note that the intersection of any three hexagons is just the middle square plus one small triangle on the side. Again, the middle square have area <math>1<\/math> and the triangle have area <math>\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}<\/math>, so the total is <math>1+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}<\/math>. We multiply that by <math>4\\choose3<\/math> to get <math>4+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}<\/math>.\n\nThen, we calculate the area of the intersection of all four hexagons, which is just the middle square with area <math>1<\/math>. \n\nFinally, we apply PIE.

For how many values of <math>n \\le 50<\/math> is <math>f_{50}(n) = 12?<\/math>","solution":["First, we can test values that would make <math>f(x)=12<\/math> true. For this to happen <math>x<\/math> must have <math>6<\/math> divisors, which means its prime factorization is in the form <math>pq^2<\/math> or <math>p^5<\/math>, where <math>p<\/math> and <math>q<\/math> are prime numbers. Listing out values less than <math>50<\/math> which have these prime factorizations, we find <math>12,18,20,28,44,45,50<\/math> for <math>pq^2<\/math>, and just <math>32<\/math> for <math>p^5<\/math>. Here <math>12<\/math> especially catches our eyes, as this means if one of <math>f_i(n)=12<\/math>, each of <math>f_{i+1}(n), f_{i+2}(n), ...<\/math> will all be <math>12<\/math>. This is because <math>f_{i+1}(n)=f(f_i(n))<\/math> (as given in the problem statement), so were <math>f_i(n)=12<\/math>, plugging this in we get <math>f_{i+1}(n)=f(12)=12<\/math>, and thus the pattern repeats. Hence, as long as for a <math>i<\/math>, such that <math>i\\leq 50<\/math> and <math>f_{i}(n)=12<\/math>, <math>f_{50}(n)=12<\/math> must be true, which also immediately makes all our previously listed numbers, where <math>f(x)=12<\/math>, possible values of <math>n<\/math>.\n\nWe also know that if <math>f(x)<\/math> were to be any of these numbers, <math>x<\/math> would satisfy <math>f_{50}(n)<\/math> as well. Looking through each of the possibilities aside from <math>12<\/math>, we see that <math>f(x)<\/math> could only possibly be equal to <math>20<\/math> and <math>18<\/math>, and still have <math>x<\/math> less than or equal to <math>50<\/math>. This would mean <math>x<\/math> must have <math>10<\/math>, or <math>9<\/math> divisors, and testing out, we see that <math>x<\/math> will then be of the form <math>p^4q<\/math>, or <math>p^2q^2<\/math>. The only two values less than or equal to <math>50<\/math> would be <math>48<\/math> and <math>36<\/math> respectively. From here there are no more possible values, so tallying our possibilities we count <math>\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }10}<\/math> values (Namely <math>12,18,20,28,32,36,44,45,48,50<\/math>).\n\n~Ericsz\n","First, take note that the maximum possible value of <math>f_1(n)<\/math> for <math>1 \\le n \\le k<\/math> increases as <math>k<\/math> increases (it is a step function), i.e. it is increasing. Likewise, as <math>k<\/math> decreases, the maximum possible value of <math>f_1(n)<\/math> decreases as well. Also, let <math>f_1(n) = 2d(n)<\/math> where <math>d(n)<\/math> is the number of divisors of n.\n\nSince <math>n \\le 50<\/math>, <math>f_1(n) <= 20<\/math>. This maximum occurs when <math>d(n) = 10 \\implies n = 2^4 \\cdot 3 = 48<\/math>. Next, since <math>f_1(n) <=20<\/math>, <math>f_1(f_1(n)) \\le 12 \\implies f_2(n) \\le 12<\/math>. This maximum occurs when <math>d(f_1(n)) = 6 \\implies n = 2 \\cdot 3^2 = 18, n = 2^2 \\cdot 3 = 12<\/math>. Since <math>f_2(n) \\le 12<\/math>, <math>f_1(f_2(n)) \\le 12 \\implies f_3(n) \\le 12<\/math>, once again. This maximum again occurs when <math>d(f_2(n)) = 6 \\implies f_2(n) = 2^2 \\cdot 3 = 12<\/math>. Now, suppose for the sake of contradiction that <math>f_2(n) < 12<\/math>. Then, <math>f_3(n) < 12<\/math> (since <math>f_2(n) = 12<\/math> was the only number that would maximize <math>f_3(n))<\/math> for <math>f_2(n) \\le 12<\/math>). As a result, since <math>f_1(n)<\/math> is increasing, and because <math>12<\/math> is where <math>f_1<\/math> steps down from a maximum of <math>6 \\cdot 2 = 12<\/math>, we must have that <math>f_1(f_3(n)) < f_1(12) = 12 \\implies f_4(n) < 12<\/math>. We continue applying <math>f_1<\/math> on both sides (which is possible since <math>f_1<\/math> is increasing) until we reach <math>f_50<\/math>, giving us that <math>f_50(n) < 12<\/math>. However, <math>f_50(n) = 12<\/math>, which is a contradiction. Thus, <math>f_2(n) = 12<\/math>. \n\nNow, let us finally solve for the solutions. <math>f_2(n) = 12 \\implies f_1(f_1(n)) = 12 \\implies d(f_1(n)) = 6<\/math>. <math>d(f_1(n)) = 6 \\implies f_1(n) = p^2 \\cdot q<\/math> where <math>p<\/math> and <math>q<\/math> are primes. Since <math>f_1(n) \\le 20<\/math>, <math>f_1(n)<\/math> can only be <math>12<\/math>, <math>18<\/math>, or <math>20<\/math>. If <math>f_1(n) = 12<\/math>, then <math>d(n) = 6 \\implies n = p^5, p^2 \\cdot q \\implies n \\in \\{ 12, 18, 20, 28, 32, 44, 45, 50 \\}<\/math>, resulting in 8 solutions. If <math>f_1(n) = 18<\/math>, then <math>d(n) = 9 \\implies n = p^8, p^2 \\cdot q^2 \\implies n = 36<\/math>, giving us one more solution. Finally, <math>f_1(n) = 20 \\implies d(n) = 10 \\implies n = p^9, p^4 \\cdot q \\implies n = 48<\/math>.

Let <math>\\tilde{p}(x)<\/math> have roots <math>x_1, x_2<\/math>. So, the equation <math>\\tilde{p}(\\tilde{p}(x))<\/math> becomes two separate equations:\n<cmath>\\begin{align*}\nx^2+bx+c=x_1, \\\\\nx^2+bx+c=x_2.\n\\end{align*}<\/cmath>\nLet <math>r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4<\/math> be the roots of <math>\\tilde{p}(\\tilde{p}(x))<\/math>. Since there are <math>3<\/math> real roots, then either one of them is complex, or two of them are the same. It is known that if complex number <math>w<\/math> is a root to a certain polynomial, then so is <math>\\overline{w}<\/math>. So, if one root to <math>\\tilde{p}(\\tilde{p}(x))<\/math> is complex, then another root should also be complex \u2014 we can't have that. So, two roots are equal; WLOG, assume it is <math>r_3=r_4<\/math>. That means the roots to <math>\\tilde{p}(\\tilde{p}(x))<\/math> are <math>r_1,r_2,r_3,r_3<\/math>.\n\nNow, if the roots of <math>x^2+bx+c=x_1<\/math> are <math>r_1<\/math> and <math>r_3<\/math> and the roots of <math>x^2+bx+c=x_2<\/math> are <math>r_2<\/math> and <math>r_3<\/math>, then we have <math>-b = r_1+r_3 = r_2+r_3<\/math> giving <math>r_1=r_2<\/math> by [[Vieta's Formula]]. That can't happen either. So, <math>x^2+bx+c=x_1<\/math> must have roots <math>r_1, r_2<\/math> and <math>x^2+bx+c=x_2<\/math> must have a double root <math>r_3<\/math>. Again by Vieta's, we have\n<cmath>\\begin{align*}\nr_1+r_2&=-b, \\\\\n2r_3&=-b.\n\\end{align*}<\/cmath>\nThat implies <math>r_2-r_3=r_3-r_1<\/math>. So, let <math>r_1=r_3-k<\/math> and <math>r_2=r_3+k<\/math>. Also, from <math>2r_3=-b<\/math>, we have <math>r_3=-\\frac{b}{2}<\/math>. By Vieta's again, we have\n<cmath>\\begin{align*}\nr_1\\cdot r_2 &= c-x_1 = r_1\\cdot r_2 = (r_3-k)(r_3-k) = r_3^2-k^2, \\\\\nr_3^2&=c-x_2.\n\\end{align*}<\/cmath>\nSubtracting yields <math>x_1-x_2=k^2<\/math>. Adding that with <math>x_1+x_2=-b<\/math> brings us to\n<cmath>\\begin{align*}\nx_1 &= \\frac{k^2-b}{2}, \\\\\nx_2 &= \\frac{-k^2-b}{2}.\n\\end{align*}<\/cmath>\nThus, <math>c=x_1\\cdot x_2=\\frac{b^2-k^4}{4}<\/math>. Now, <math>c-x_2 = r_3^2<\/math> by Vieta's. Plugging in <math>c, x_2, r_3=-\\frac{b}{2}<\/math> gives\n<cmath>\\frac{b^2-k^4}{4} + \\frac{k^2+b}{2} = \\frac{b^2-k^4+2k^2-2b}{4} = \\frac{b^2}{4}.<\/cmath>\nSimplifying yields <math>2b=k^4-2k^2=(k^2-1)^2-1 \\ge -1<\/math> by [[Trivial Inequality]]. Thus, <math>\\text{min}(b) = -\\frac{1}{2}<\/math>. Since <math>\\tilde{p}(x)<\/math> have the maximum value to the sum of the roots, which is <math>-b<\/math>, we want to minimize <math>b<\/math>. That means that <math>b<\/math> for <math>\\tilde{p}(x)<\/math> is <math>\\frac{1}{2}<\/math>. That means <math>k^2=1<\/math> and <math>c=-\\frac{3}{16}<\/math>, and thus giving us <math>\\tilde{p}(1) = 1+b+c = 1-\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{3}{16} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{5}{16}}<\/math>.\n\n~sml1809\n","\nLet <math>p(x)=(x-r_1)(x-r_2)<\/math>.

Thus, the equation of the circumcircle of <math>\\triangle BDE<\/math> is <math>(x-\\frac{132}{31})^2+(y+\\frac{684}{31\\sqrt7})^2=(\\frac{768}{31\\sqrt7})^2<\/math>.\n\nPoint <math>F<\/math> is the intersection of this circle and the line <math>\\overline{AB}<\/math>, which has equation <math>y=\\frac{5\\sqrt7}{9}x<\/math>. So, we substitute <math>y=\\frac{5\\sqrt7}{9}x<\/math> into the equation of the circle to get <math>(x-\\frac{132}{31})^2+(\\frac{5\\sqrt7}{9}x+\\frac{684}{31\\sqrt7})^2=(\\frac{768}{31\\sqrt7})^2<\/math>.\n\nAfter simplifying, we have <math>\\frac{256}{81}x^2+16x=0<\/math> (the <math>\\frac{768}{31\\sqrt7}<\/math>'s cancel out), whose solutions are <math>x=0<\/math> and <math>x=-\\frac{81}{16}<\/math>. The first corresponds to the origin, and the second corresponds to point <math>F<\/math>.

Thus, the leading term of the quotient is <math>z^{2019}<\/math>. Multiplying <math>z^{2019}<\/math> by the divisor gives <math>z^{2021}+z^{2020}+z^{2019}<\/math>. We have our <math>z^{2021}<\/math> term but we have these unnecessary terms like <math>z^{2020}<\/math>. We can get rid of these terms by adding <math>-z^{2018}<\/math> to the quotient to cancel out these terms, but this then gives us <math>z^{2021}-z^{2018}<\/math>. Our first instinct will probably be to add <math>z^{2017}<\/math>, but we can't do this as although this will eliminate the <math>-z^{2018}<\/math> term, it will produce a <math>z^{2019}<\/math> term. Since no other term of the form <math>z^n<\/math> where <math>n<\/math> is an integer less than <math>2017<\/math> will produce a <math>z^{2019}<\/math> term when multiplied by the divisor, we can't add <math>z^{2017}<\/math> to the quotient. Instead, we can add <math>z^{2016}<\/math> to the coefficient to get rid of the <math>-z^{2018}<\/math> term. Continuing this pattern, we get the quotient as <cmath>z^{2019}-z^{2018}+z^{2016}-z^{2015}+\\cdots-z^2+1.<\/cmath>\nThe last term when multiplied with the divisor gives <math>z^2+z+1<\/math>. This will get rid of the <math>-z^2<\/math> term but will produce the expression <math>z+1<\/math>, giving us the dividend as <math>z^{2021}+z+1<\/math>. Note that the dividend we want is of the form <math>z^{2021}+1<\/math>. Therefore, our remainder will have to be <math>-z<\/math> in order to get rid of the <math>z<\/math> term in the expression and give us <math>z^{2021}+1<\/math>, which is what we want.

We can assume that for the starting position <math>(6, 2, 1)<\/math>, Beth always has a move to ensure that she can continue to mirror Arjun throughout the game. (This could be proven rigorously with lots of casework. In particular, she must avoid providing Arjun with a position of 3 continuous bricks, because then he could take the middle block and force a win.)

If we see this in practice, Arjun has made the block in to <math>(2,2,1,1)<\/math>. If Beth takes 1, he will take one. If Beth takes 2, he will take 2 as well.\n\nThen, we can guess solution <math>B<\/math>, <math>(6,2,1)<\/math>. If Arjun starts by taking 1 of the blocks, he will either have <math>(6,1,1)<\/math>, <math>(6,2)<\/math>, <math>(x,y,2,1)<\/math> (Where <math>x+y = 5<\/math>). If he has <math>(6,1,1)<\/math>, Beth can take 2 out of the middle of <math>(6,1,1)<\/math> to get <math>(2,2,1,1)<\/math> which we know Arjun will lose because we know by symmetry from answer choice <math>A<\/math>. If he has <math>(6,2)<\/math>, Beth will take out one from the edge, and we get <math>(5,2)<\/math>. Beth can now copy whatever Arjun does, so she will win. \n\nNext, if he takes one out to get <math>(x,y,2,1)<\/math>, we can either have <math>(4,1,2,1)<\/math> or <math>(3,2,2,1)<\/math>. If it is the first case, Beth can take the edge 2 out of the 4, which gives us <math>(2,1,2,1)<\/math> and whatever Arjun does, Beth can do, so she has established a win. If it is the 2nd case, Beth can take out 2 from the 3 to get <math>(1,2,2,1)<\/math>, in which, Beth can copy whatever Arjun does, so Beth will win. So in all 4 cases, Beth wins.

The line <math>y=\\frac{2}{3}x<\/math> separates the area inside the box so that <math>\\frac{2}{3}<\/math> of the are is above the line. \n\nI find that the number of coordinates with <math>x=1<\/math> above the line is 30, and the number of coordinates with <math>x=2<\/math> above the line is 29. Every time the line <math>y=\\frac{2}{3}x<\/math> hits a y-value with an integer coordinate, the number of points above the line decreases by one. I wrote out the sum of 30 terms in hopes of finding a pattern. I graphed the first couple positive integer x-coordinates, and found that the sum of the integers above the line is <math>30+29+28+28+27+26+26 \\ldots+ 10<\/math>. The even integer repeats itself every third term in the sum. I found that the average of each of the terms is 20, and there are 30 of them which means that exactly 600 above the line as desired. This give a lower bound because if the slope decreases a little bit, then the points that the line goes through will be above the line. \n\nTo find the upper bound, notice that each point with an integer-valued x-coordinate is either <math>\\frac{1}{3}<\/math> or <math>\\frac{2}{3}<\/math> above the line. Since the slope through a point is the y-coordinate divided by the x-coordinate, a shift in the slope will increase the y-value of the higher x-coordinates. We turn our attention to <math>x=28, 29, 30<\/math> which the line <math>y=\\frac{2}{3}x<\/math> intersects at <math>y= \\frac{56}{3}, \\frac{58}{3}, 20<\/math>. The point (30,20) is already counted below the line, and we can clearly see that if we slowly increase the slope of the line, we will hit the point (28,19) since (28, <math>\\frac{56}{3}<\/math>) is closer to the lattice point. The slope of the line which goes through both the origin and (28,19) is <math>y=\\frac{19}{28}x<\/math>. This gives an upper bound of <math>m=\\frac{19}{28}<\/math>. \n\nTaking the upper bound of m and subtracting the lower bound yields <math>\\frac{19}{28}-\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{1}{84}<\/math>.

Graphing <math>|x-y| > \\tfrac{1}{2}<\/math> gives us the following picture where the shaded area is the set of all the points that fulfill the inequality:\n\n<asy>\nfilldraw((0,0)--(0,1)--(1\/2,1)--(0,1\/2)--cycle,black+linewidth(1));\nfilldraw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1\/2)--(1\/2,0)--cycle,black+linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,1)--(1,1)--(1,0)--cycle);\n<\/asy>\n\nThe shaded area is <math>\\frac{1}{4}<\/math>, which means the probability for success for case 4 is <math>\\frac{1}{4}<\/math> (since the total area of the bounding square, containing all possible pairs, is <math>1<\/math>).\n\nAdding up the success rates from each case, we get:\n\n<math>\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{7}{16}}<\/math>.\n\n","Taking into account that there are two options for the result of the first coin flip, there are four possible combinations with equal possibility of initial coins flips.\n\n(1) x: heads, y: heads\n\n(2) x: heads, y: tails\n\n(3) x: tails, y: heads\n\n(4) x: tails, y: tails\n\n(1) Because x and y both must be integers, so it's simple to see that the probability that <math>|x-y| > \\tfrac{1}{2}<\/math> is <math>\\frac{1}{2}<\/math>.\n\n(2) Since x has to be an integer it is also easy to see that the probability is again <math>\\frac{1}{2}<\/math>.\n\n(3) This is the same as case 2 so the probability is <math>\\frac{1}{2}<\/math>.\n\n(4) This one is a little bit tricky. You could use geometric probability shown above, but if you don't understand it or happened to not think of it, there is another solution that involves using the multiple choice answers. \n\nFirst, the probability we have so far is <math>\\frac{3}{8}<\/math>.This is greater than <math>\\frac{1}{3}<\/math> so <math>A<\/math> is the not the answer. It is either <math>B, C, D,<\/math> or <math>E<\/math>. Let's draw out the probability with two parallel lines on a paper with represent a number line from <math>0-1<\/math>. The concept is to compare one point and find the fraction of the other line that contains points that are at least <math>\\frac{1}{2}<\/math> away from it. If the point we choose is on the endpoints, then the fraction of the other line that works is exactly <math>\\frac{1}{2}<\/math>. But as we move this point closer to the middle, the deadzone (area where the other point cannot be) grows, diminishing the probability. Finally, when it is directly in the middle, there are no points that pass the requirements except at <math>1<\/math> and <math>0<\/math>.\n\nSo, looking at the choices again, we have <math>\\frac{7}{16}<\/math>, <math>\\frac{1}{2}<\/math>, <math>\\frac{9}{16}<\/math>, and <math>\\frac{2}{3}<\/math>. \n\n<math>\\frac{1}{2}<\/math> is exactly <math>\\frac{1}{8}<\/math> more than the probability we had before.

This is because even if we make all of the other <math>a_{i}<\/math> equal to <math>1<\/math>, we will have that our number is <math>(-1)(3^{7}) + (3^{6}+3^{5}+...+3^{0}) = -3^{7} + \\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1}<\/math>.

This then simplifies the problem: the question remains the same, except that instead of having <math>a_{0}...a_{7}<\/math>, we only have <math>a_{0}...a_{6}<\/math>.

Then, the problem is asking us for <math>S_{7}<\/math>, and the total number of nonnegative integers we get from this case is <math>S_{6}<\/math>. Let's keep this in mind and revisit this idea later.\nIf <math>a_{7}=1<\/math>, we can show that no matter what values we assign to the rest of the <math>a_{i}<\/math>, we will always get a nonnegative integer (we can make this even stricter and say positive integer). This is because of something we figured out in the first case: <math>\\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1} < 3^{7}<\/math>. So, even if we let <math>a_{i}=-1<\/math> for <math>0 \\leq i \\leq 6<\/math>, we will still have <math>3^{7} - (3^{6}+...+3^{0}) > 0<\/math>. So, for this case, we have <math>3^7<\/math> possible nonnegative integers.\nTotalling up our values from the three cases, we see that <math>S_{7} = 0 + S_{6} + 3^{7}<\/math>. In fact, using the reasoning from the three cases above, we can deduce that, for all positive integers <math>n<\/math>, <math>S_{n} = 3^{n} + S_{n-1}<\/math>.

Even though it may not be as quick as some of the solutions above, I feel like it is an interesting concept, and may be more motivated. \n\nTo begin, we consider the sequence <math>B<\/math> formed when we take the difference of consecutive terms between <math>A.<\/math> Define <math>b_n = a_{n+1} - a_n.<\/math> Notice that for <math>n \\ge 4,<\/math> we have <center><math>\\begin{cases}\\begin{aligned} a_{n+1} &= a_{n} - a_{n-1} + (n+1) \\\\ a_{n} &= a_{n-1} - a_{n-2} + n \\end{aligned}.\\end{cases}<\/math><\/center> Notice that subtracting the second equation from the first, we see that <math>b_{n} = b_{n-1} - b_{n-2} + 1.<\/math> \n\nIf you didn\u2019t notice that <math>B<\/math> repeated directly in the solution above, you could also, possibly more naturally, take the finite differences of the sequence <math>b_n<\/math> so that you could define <math>c_n = b_{n+1} - b_n.<\/math> Using a similar method as above through reindexing and then subtracting, you could find that <math>c_n = c_{n-1} - c_{n-2}.<\/math> The sum of any six consecutive terms of a sequence which satisfies such a recursion is <math>0,<\/math> in which you have that <math>b_{n} = b_{n+6}.<\/math> In the case in which finite differences didn\u2019t reduce to such a special recursion, you could still find the first few terms of <math>C<\/math> to see if there are any patterns, now that you have a much simpler sequence.

Since all of Isabella's test scores can be expressed as the sum of <math>90<\/math> and an integer between <math>1<\/math> and <math>10<\/math>, we rewrite the problem into receiving scores between <math>1<\/math> and <math>10<\/math>. Later, we can add <math>90<\/math> to her score to obtain the real answer.\n\nFrom this point of view, the problem states that Isabella's score on the seventh test was <math>5<\/math>. We note that Isabella received <math>7<\/math> integer scores out of <math>1<\/math> to <math>10<\/math>. Since <math>5<\/math> is already given as the seventh test score, the possible scores for Isabella on the other six tests are <math>S={1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10}<\/math>. \n\nThe average score for the seven tests must be an integer. In other words, six distinct integers must be picked from set <math>S<\/math> above, and their sum with <math>5<\/math> must be a multiple of <math>7<\/math>. The interval containing the possible sums of the six numbers in S are from <math>1 +2+3+4+6+7=23<\/math> to <math>4+6+7+8+9+10=44<\/math>. We must now find multiples of <math>7<\/math> from the interval <math>23+5 = 28<\/math> to <math>44+5=49<\/math>. There are four possibilities: <math>28<\/math>, <math>35<\/math>, <math>42<\/math>, <math>49<\/math>.\nHowever, we also note that the sum of the six numbers (besides <math>5<\/math>) must be a multiple of <math>6<\/math> as well. Thus, <math>35<\/math> is the only valid choice.(The six numbers sum to <math>30<\/math>.)\n\nThus the sum of the six numbers equals to <math>30<\/math>. We apply the logic above in a similar way for the sum of the scores from the first test to the fifth test. The sum must be a multiple of <math>5<\/math>. The possible interval is from <math>1+2+3+4+6=16<\/math> to <math>6+7+8+9+10=40<\/math>.

If the <math>a_6<\/math> is different from the <math>a_7<\/math>, then the last score must be a multiple of 7 away from <math>a_6<\/math>. However, <math>95-7=88<\/math> and <math>95+7=102<\/math> clearly cannot be <math>a_6<\/math> since they are outside the range of 91 to 100. Thus, <math>a_6<\/math> must be 95. Additionally, <math>a_5<\/math> cannot be 95 since that would mean the sixth score is 95, which isn't possible since scores can't repeat (also, it's not an answer choice). Intuitively, <math>a_5<\/math> should be close to 95 due to the constraint on the range of scores. We can try 94 and 96 for <math>a_5<\/math>. Again, the sixth score must be a multiple of 6 (preferably only one multiple) away from <math>a_5<\/math>.

We need to make sure that for each person that gave in total certain amount, they received in total from other people that same amount, or in other words, we want it such that there are an equal number of A's, B's, C's, and D's in both columns of the matrix.\n\nFor example, the matrix below represents: A gives B a coin, then B gives C a coin, then C gives D a coin, and finally A gives D a coin, in this order. \n<cmath>\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} & A & B & \\\\\n& B & C & \\\\\n& C & D & \\\\\n& A & D & \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\] <\/cmath>\nCase 1: <math>2<\/math> people. In this case, we have <math>\\binom{4}{2}<\/math> ways to choose the two people, and <math>\\binom{4}{2}<\/math> ways to order them to get a count of <math>{\\binom{4}{2}}^2 = 36<\/math> ways.\n\nCase 2: <math>3<\/math> people. In this case, one special person is giving\/receiving twice. There are four ways to choose this person, then of the remaining three people we choose two, to be the people interacting with the special person. Thus, we have <math>4\\cdot\\binom{3}{2}\\cdot4! = 288<\/math> ways here.\n\nCase 3: <math>4<\/math> people. In this case. First note that no person can give\/receive twice. If we keep the order of A, B, C, D giving in that order (and permute afterward), then there are three options to choose A's receiver, and three options for B's receiver afterward. Then it is uniquely determined who C and D give to. This gives a total of <math>3\\cdot3\\cdot4! = 216<\/math> ways, after permuting.\n\n\nSo we have a total of <math>36+288+216=540<\/math> ways to order the four pairs of people. \nNow we divide this by the total number of ways: <math>(4\\cdot3)^4<\/math> \n(four rounds, four ways to choose giver, three to choose receiver each round).\nSo the answer is <math>\\frac{540}{12^4} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\frac{5}{192}}<\/math>.\n\n~ccx09 \n\nLatex polished by Argonauts16 and by [[Grace.yongqing.yu]].\n","Similar to solution 2, we think in terms of transactions. WLOG, for the 1st transaction, we assume that A gives to B, which we denote AB. For the 2nd transaction, there are 12 options to choose from, so there are <math>12^3<\/math> possible options.\n\nCase 1 (Giving back immediately): The 2nd transaction is BA (1 option). Then, the 3rd transaction can be whatever you like (12 options), but the 4th transaction is now fixed to be the opposite of the 3rd transaction (1 option). So here we have <math>1\\cdot 12\\cdot 1 = 12<\/math> good options.\n\nCase 2 (Allows a cycle or two back-and-forths): The 2nd transaction is one of BC, BD, CA, DA, CD, DC (6 options). Then, for the 3rd transaction, 2 options force a \"cycle\" on the 4th transaction (example 2.1), and 2 options force two \"back-and-forths\" on the 4th transaction (example 2.2). In total, there are <math>2+2=4<\/math> options for the 3rd transaction. So here we have <math>6\\cdot 4\\cdot 1 = 24<\/math> good options. \n\nExample 2.1: suppose 2nd = BC. Then if 3rd = DA or CD, the 4th is forced to be CD or DA respectively, completing a transaction \"cycle\"\n\nExample 2.2: suppose 2nd = BC. Then if 3rd = AB or BC, the 4th is forced to be BC or AB respectively. In the end, both A-B and B-C had back-and-forth transactions\n\nCase 3 (Allows two back-and-forths only): The 2nd transaction is one of AC, AD, DB, CB (4 options). Then, for the 3th transaction, there are only 2 possible options (namely, to reverse one of the previous transactions). Of course, the final transaction is forced. Here, we have <math>4\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = 8<\/math> good options.\n\nCase 4 (AB again): The 2nd transaction is AB (same as 1st). This forces the later transactions to both be BA. Here we have 1 good option.\n\nSumming, we have <math>12+24+8+1=45<\/math> good options among <math>12^3<\/math> total options, so the solution is <math>\\frac{45}{(12^3)}= \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\frac{5}{192}}<\/math>. \n\nSilverLion\n\n","\nDefine a cycle of length <math>n<\/math> to be a sequence of <math>n<\/math> transactions, starting and ending with the same person.

The third line also has a positive slope and cuts a <math>45-45-90<\/math> triangle with side length <math>1 - z<\/math> off the bottom right corner of the square. \n\nNote: All triangles are <math>45-45-90<\/math> because the lines have slopes of <math>1<\/math> or <math>-1<\/math>.\n\nUsing the <math>><\/math> and <math><<\/math> signs in the lines, we see that the area that satisfies all three inequalities is the area not enclosed in the three triangles. So, our plan of attack will be to\n\nFind the area of the triangles -> Subtract that from the area of the square -> Use probability to get the answer.\n\nExcept, now, we have one problem. <math>z<\/math> is still a variable. But, we want <math>z<\/math> to be a constant. Well, what if we just took the area over every possible value of <math>z<\/math>?

Thus, the total length the second point can exist in can be represented by <math>f(n)=4-(0.5+n+\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}-n^2})<\/math>. Distributing, <math>f(n)=3.5-n-\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}-n^2}<\/math>.\n\nThen, we can find the average of this function through calculus (wow more calc?). This formula is as follows,\n<cmath>\\frac{1}{a_{f} -a_{i}} \\int_{a_{i}}^{a_{f}} f(x)\\;dx<\/cmath>\n\nFor this case, the limits of integration are <math>0<\/math> and <math>0.5<\/math> (<math>0\\leq n\\leq 0.5<\/math>).

Graphing the first two, you can see that the first is a rectangle of length <math>0.5<\/math> and width <math>3.5<\/math>. The second is an isosceles right triangle of leg length <math>0.5<\/math>.\n\n<cmath>\\int_{0}^{\\frac{1}{2}} 3.5\\;dn=\\frac{7}{4}, \\int_{0}^{\\frac{1}{2}}n\\;dn=\\frac{1}{8}<\/cmath>\n\nRecognize that the third integral is a semicircle of radius <math>0.5<\/math> and centered at the origin.

Notice that each segment is the same, so WLOG use any one of them. For the purposes of this solution, I will assume the segment we use starts at (0, 0) and ends at (0.5, 0). The square I use will have vertices of <math>(0,0)<\/math>, <math>(1,0)<\/math>, <math>(0,1)<\/math>, and <math>(1,1)<\/math>. \n\nA way we can figure out when the distance is at least <math>0.5<\/math> is if we figure out when it isn't <math>0.5<\/math>. Let's pick a point on our segment and denote it with <math>(x, 0)<\/math>. Then, there are three ways a second point can be within the boundaries of this first point. Either, it is to the left of it (if possible), to the right of it, or it is on the segment that forms a right angle with it. \n\nObviously, there is <math>x<\/math> distance if the point is to the left of the point <math>x<\/math>. Since we denoted this segment to be from <math>0<\/math> to <math>0.5<\/math>, then there will always be <math>0.5<\/math> distance to the right of the point <math>x<\/math> (as that's the maximum that we are trying to figure out).\n\nThe difficult part is finding the total length on the segment that is perpendicular to our segment. However, since the square has a right angle, we can first find that the segment should have a length of <math>\\sqrt{0.25-x^2}<\/math> (by the Pythagorean theorem, with hypotenuse 0.5 and one leg being x).\n\nNow that we have our three distances, all we need to do is find the average value of them. We can best do this with \"Integral\/Interval\", and so we take the integral from <math>0<\/math> to <math>0.5<\/math> of <math>x+0.5+\\sqrt{0.25-x^2}<\/math> and then divide it by <math>0.5<\/math> (the interval). To integrate <math>\\sqrt{0.25-x^2}<\/math> by hand, we want to pull out the <math>1\/4<\/math>, and then apply u-sub and our integration rules to find the answer. \n\nWe get <math>0.75 - \\frac{\\pi}{16} \\cdot 2<\/math>. Simplify this into <math>\\frac{6-\\pi}{8}<\/math>. \n\nNow we are on our last stage. Proceed to make this equivalent to what the question is asking, as we have found the probability that the second point is within a distance of <math>0.5<\/math>, whereas the question asks for at least a distance of <math>0.5<\/math> (so more than). We can do this simply by doing <math>4- \\frac{6-\\pi}{8}<\/math> (as <math>4<\/math> is the total amount of length). This equates to <math>\\frac{26-\\pi}{8}<\/math> and then we divide by <math>4<\/math> as that is the total amount of length (remember this is probability). \n\nThus, we get <math>\\frac{26-\\pi}{32}<\/math> for our probability, and so the answer is <math>26 + 1 + 32 = \\textbf{(A)}\\ 59<\/math>.\n\nSome notes: I tried to explain everything but it's quite difficult to explain - there is a way of non-calculus (like there always is) that I think was mentioned above, something with circles (since the thing under the square root is just <math>x^2+y^2 = \\frac{1}{4}<\/math>, so finding the average value of that isn't difficult). \n\nIronicNinja~ Edited by AngelaLZ~\n","Choose a certain side for one of the points to be on.

Now, instead of each person being seated not in the same chair and not in an adjacent chair, each person will be seated either in the same chair or an adjacent chair. The problem now becomes the number of ways in which six people can sit down in a chair that is either the same chair or an adjacent chair in a circle.\n\nConsider the similar problem of <math>n<\/math> people sitting in a chair that is either the same chair or an adjacent chair in a row.

Note that any such permutation cannot have a 1-cycle, so the only possible types of permutations are 2,2,2-cycles, 4,2-cycles, 3,3-cycles, and 6-cycles. We deal with each case separately.\n\nFor 2,2,2-cycles, suppose that one of the 2-cycles switches the people across from each other, i.e. <math>(14)<\/math>, <math>(25)<\/math>, or <math>(36)<\/math>. WLOG, we may assume it to be <math>(14)<\/math>. Then we could either have both of the other 2-cycles be across from each other, giving the permutation <math>(14)(25)(36)<\/math> or else neither of the other 2-cycles is across from each other, in which case the only possible permutation is <math>(14)(26)(35)<\/math>. This can happen for <math>(25)<\/math> and <math>(36)<\/math> as well. So since the first permutation is not counted twice, we find a total of <math>1+3=4<\/math> permutations that are 2,2,2-cycles where at least one of the 2-cycles switches people diametrically opposite from each other. Otherwise, since the elements in a 2-cycle cannot differ by 1, 3, or 5 mod 6, they must differ by 2 or 4 mod 6, i.e. they must be of the same parity. But since we have three odd and three even elements, this is impossible. Hence there are exactly 4 such permutations that are 2,2,2-cycles.\n\nFor 4,2-cycles, we assume for the moment that 1 is part of the 2-cycle. Then the 2-cycle can be <math>(13)<\/math>, <math>(15)<\/math>, or <math>(14)<\/math>. The first two are essentially the same by symmetry, and we must arrange the elements 2, 4, 5, 6 into a 4-cycle. However, 5 must have two neighbors that are not next to it, which is impossible, hence the first two cases yield no permutations. If the 2-cycle is <math>(14)<\/math>, then we must arrange the elements 2, 3, 5, 6 into a 4-cycle. Then 2 must have the neighbors 5 and 6. We find that the 4-cycles <math>(2536)<\/math> and <math>(2635)<\/math> satisfy the desired properties, yielding the permutations <math>(14)(2536)<\/math> and <math>(14)(2635)<\/math>. This can be done for the 2-cycles <math>(25)<\/math> and <math>(36)<\/math> as well, so we find a total of 6 such permutations that are 4,2-cycles.\n\nFor 3,3-cycles, note that if 1 neighbor 4, then the third element in the cycle will neighbor one of 1 and 4, so this is impossible. Therefore, the 3-cycle containing 1 must consist of elements 1, 3, and 5. Therefore, we obtain the four 3,3-cycles <math>(135)(246)<\/math>, <math>(153)(246)<\/math>, <math>(135)(264)<\/math>, and <math>(153)(264)<\/math>.\n\nFor 6-cycles, note that the neighbors of 1 can be 3 and 4, 3 and 5, or 4 and 5. In the first case, we may assume that it looks like <math>(314\\dots)<\/math> -- the form <math>(413\\dots)<\/math> is also possible but equivalent to this case. Then we must place the elements 2, 5, and 6. Note that 5 and 6 cannot go together, so 2 must go in between them. Also, 5 cannot neighbor 4, so we are left with one possibility, namely <math>(314625)<\/math>, which has an analogous possibility <math>(413526)<\/math>. In the second case, we assume that it looks like <math>(315\\dots)<\/math>. The 2 must go next to the 5, and the 6 must go last (to neighbor the 3), so the only possibility here is <math>(315246)<\/math>, with the analogous possibility <math>(513642)<\/math>. In the final case, we may assume that it looks like <math>(415\\dots)<\/math>. Then the 2 and 3 cannot go together, so the 6 must go in between them. Therefore, the only possibility is <math>(415362)<\/math>, with the analogous possibility <math>(514263)<\/math>. We have covered all possibilities for 6-cycles, and we have found 6 of them.\n\nTherefore, there are <math>4+6+4+6 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\; 20}<\/math> such permutations.\n","\nNotice the question is not any different than counting the cases if someone either stays put or moves one seat to the left or right (as in the above solution). WLOG, say the beginning case is ABCDEF (before any transformations). Thus, we can count these cases up:\n\nCase 1: Everyone stays put.\nThen, there is only one case (ABCDEF).\n\nCase 2: Everyone moves.\nNotice that if A moves to the right to B's seat, B has either two options. B can move to the left (to A's seat) or move to the right to C's seat. If B moves to C's seat, C cannot cancel the loop by going to A's seat, since we set the restriction as each person can only move ONE seat to the left\/right. The only way to finish this process would be C moving to D, D moving to E, E moving to F, and F moving to A, achieving FABCDE as a case. Of course, A can move left and the same loop would occur but in the opposite direction (BCDEFA). Thus, we achieve two cases.\n\nCase 3: The movement of seats cancel out each other.\nIf A moves to B's seat, B can move to A's seat, canceling the cycle. In this case, we would look to C, where this same thing could happen (note, however, that if C moves to D's seat, D cannot move to E's seat as the loop would be unachievable; furthermore, note that C cannot move to B's seat if A is already there since that would mean A would have to move to C's seat which is restricted).\n\nWe can count these cases by grouping each pair and then doing subcases:\n\nSubcase 1: AB CD and EF are grouped.\nHere we have 2*2*2 = 8 cases, but they cannot all stay put since we've already counted that possibility in Case 1, and thus there are 7 cases here.\n\nSubcase 2: BC DE and FA are grouped.\nHere again, we have 2*2*2 = 8 cases, and then subtract the overcounted case to get 7 cases.\n\nSubcase 3: There is overlap so that two people do not change.\nIf A and B change seats, D and E could change seats, and this would not have been counted by the previous groupings (since its an odd parity grouping + an even parity grouping). Count this simply by listing out the cases, or notice that this just means the two people sitting three seats away not moving. There are three cases of that happening (A and D not moving, B and E not moving, and C and F not moving).\n\nLook back at all our cases.

Assuming <math>P_0<\/math> lies at the origin, we can calculate the distance the bee traveled to <math>P_{2015}<\/math> by evaluating the distance the bee traveled in the x-direction and the y-direction.

This means we simply need to answer the question; how far will the bee be when the bee is facing in the same direction? \n\n\nFirst we use the fact that after 3 turns, the bee will be facing in a direction perpendicular to the the initial direction. From here we can draw a perpendicular from <math>P_2<\/math> to the line <math>\\overline{P_0P_1}<\/math> intersecting a point <math>C_0<\/math>. We will also place the point <math>C_1<\/math> at the intersection of <math>\\overline{P_0P_1}<\/math> and <math>\\overline{P_3P_4}<\/math>. In addition, the point <math>C_2<\/math> is placed at the perpendicular dropped from <math>P_2<\/math> to the line <math>\\overline{P_3C_1}<\/math>. We will also set the distance <math>\\overline{P_0P_1} = n<\/math> and thus <math>\\overline{P_1P_2} = n+1<\/math>. With this perpendicular we see that the triangle <math>\\triangle{P_1P_2C_0}<\/math> is a 30-60-90 triangle. This means that the length <math>\\overline{P_1C_0} = \\frac{(n+1)\\sqrt{3}}{2}<\/math> and the length <math>\\overline{C_1C_2} = \\frac{n+1}{2}<\/math>. We can also see that the triangle <math>\\triangle{P_2C_1P_3}<\/math> is a 30-60-90 triangle and thus <math>\\overline{C_0C_1} = \\frac{n+2}{2}<\/math> and <math>\\overline{C_2P_3} = \\frac{(n+2)\\sqrt{3}}{2}<\/math>. Now if we continue this across all <math>P_i<\/math> and set the point <math>P_0<\/math> to the coordinates <math>(0, 0)<\/math>. As you can see, we are inherently putting a \u201cbox\u201d around the figure.

The point <math>C_7<\/math> is defined as the intersection of lines <math>\\overline{P_6P_7}<\/math> and <math>\\overline{P_9P_{10}}<\/math>. Finally, the point <math>C_10<\/math> is defined as the intersection of lines <math>\\overline{P_{9}P_{10}}<\/math> and <math>\\overline{P_{12}P_{13}}<\/math>. Note that our spiral stops at <math>P_{12}<\/math> before the next spiral starts. Calculating the offset from the x and the y direction, we see that the offset, or the new point <math>P_{12}<\/math>, is <math>({-6}, {-6}-12 \\sqrt{3})<\/math>. This is an interesting property that the points\u2019 coordinate changes by a constant offset no matter what <math>n<\/math> is. Since the new point\u2019s subscript changes by 12 each time and we see that 2016 is divisible by 12, the point <math>P_{2016} = ({-168} \\cdot {6}, {168} \\cdot ({-6} \\sqrt{3} {-12}))<\/math>. Using similar 30-60-90 triangle properties, we see that <math>P_{2015} = ({-6} \\cdot 168-1008 \\sqrt{3}, 168({-6} \\sqrt{3} - 12) + 1008)<\/math>. Using the distance formula, the numbers cancel out nicely (1008 is divisible by 168, so take 168 when using the distance formula) and we see that the final answer is <math>(1008)(1+\\sqrt{3})(\\sqrt{2})<\/math> which gives us a final answer of <math>\\boxed{2024}<\/math>.\n\n-bowmanrocks32\n\n","Suppose that the bee makes a move of distance <math>i<\/math>.

Given this, we aim to find the length of segment <math>AM<\/math> so that we can un-dilate triangle <math>ABC<\/math> by dividing each of its sides by <math>AM<\/math>. Doing so will make it so that <math>AM = 1<\/math>, as desired, and doing so will allow us to get the length of <math>BN<\/math>, whose square is our final answer. \n\nLet <math>O<\/math> the foot of the altitude from <math>B<\/math> to <math>NX.<\/math> On the coordinate plane, position <math>O<\/math> at <math>(0, 0)<\/math>, and make <math>NX<\/math> lie on the x-axis. Since points <math>N<\/math>, <math>X<\/math>, and <math>C<\/math>, are collinear, <math>C<\/math> must also lie on the x-axis. Additionally, since <math>NX = 2<\/math>, <math>OB = \\sqrt{3}<\/math>, meaning that we can position point <math>B<\/math> at <math>(0, \\sqrt{3})<\/math>. Now, notice that line <math>\\overline{AB}<\/math> has the equation <math>y = \\sqrt{3}x + \\sqrt{3}<\/math> and that line <math>\\overline{BM}<\/math> has the equation <math>y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\sqrt{3}<\/math> because angles <math>BNX<\/math> and <math>BXN<\/math> are both <math>60^{\\circ}<\/math>. We can then position <math>A<\/math> at point <math>(n, \\sqrt{3}(n + 1))<\/math> and <math>C<\/math> at point <math>(p, 0)<\/math>. Quickly note that, because <math>CN<\/math> is an angle bisector, <math>AC<\/math> must pass through the point <math>(0, -\\sqrt{3})<\/math>.\n\nWe proceed to construct a system of equations. First observe that the midpoint <math>M<\/math> of <math>AC<\/math> must lie on <math>BM<\/math>, with the equation <math>y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\sqrt{3}<\/math>. The coordinates of <math>M<\/math> are <math>\\left(\\frac{p + n}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(n + 1)\\right)<\/math>, and we can plug in these coordinates into the equation of line <math>BM<\/math>, yielding that <cmath>\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(n + 1) = -\\sqrt{3}(\\frac{p + n}{2}) + \\sqrt{3} \\implies n + 1 = -p - n + 2 \\implies p = -2n + 1.<\/cmath> For our second equation, notice that line <math>AC<\/math> has equation <math>y = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{p}x - \\sqrt{3}<\/math>. Midpoint <math>M<\/math> must also lie on this line, and we can substitute coordinates again to get <cmath>\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(n + 1) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{p}(\\frac{p + n}{2}) - \\sqrt{3} \\implies n + 1 = \\frac{p + n}{p} - 2 \\implies n + 1 = \\frac{n}{p} - 1<\/cmath> <cmath>\\implies p = \\frac{n}{n + 2}.<\/cmath>\n\nSetting both equations equal to each other and multiplying both sides by <math>(n + 2)<\/math>, we have that <math>-2n^2 - 4n + n + 2 = n \\implies -2n^2 - 4n + 2 = 0<\/math>, which in turn simplifies into <math>0 = n^2 + 2n - 1<\/math> when dividing the entire equation by <math>-2.<\/math> Using the quadratic formula, we have that <cmath>n = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = -1 - \\sqrt{2}.<\/cmath> Here, we discard the positive root since <math>A<\/math> must lie to the left of the y-axis. Then, the coordinates of <math>C<\/math> are <math>(3 + 2\\sqrt{2}, 0)<\/math>, and the coordinates of <math>A<\/math> are <math>(-1 - \\sqrt{2}, -\\sqrt{6}).<\/math> Seeing that segment <math>AM<\/math> has half the length of side <math>AC<\/math>, we have that the length of <math>AM<\/math> is <cmath>\\frac{\\sqrt{(3 + 2\\sqrt{2} - (-1 - \\sqrt{2}))^2 + (\\sqrt{6})^2}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{16 + 24\\sqrt{2} + 18 + 6}}{2} = \\sqrt{10 + 6\\sqrt{2}}.<\/cmath>\n\nNow, we divide each side length of <math>\\triangle ABC<\/math> by <math>AM<\/math>, and from this, <math>BN^2<\/math> will equal <math>\\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{10 + 6\\sqrt{2}}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{5+3\\sqrt{2}} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }\\frac{10-6\\sqrt{2}}{7}.}<\/math>\n","\nBy some angle-chasing, we find that <math>\\triangle ANC \\sim \\triangle BXC<\/math>. From here, construct a point <math>D<\/math> on <math>AC<\/math> such that <math>\\triangle DXC \\sim \\triangle ANC<\/math>. Now, let <math>BC = a<\/math>, which means that <math>DM = a - 1<\/math> and <math>AD = 2 - a<\/math>, and let <math>BN = BX = XN = XD = DN = b<\/math>.

Let <math>X'<\/math> denote the foot of the perpendicular from <math>X<\/math> to base <math>AB<\/math> and define <math>D'<\/math> similarly. \n\nBecause <math>\\triangle BXX'<\/math> is a <math>30, 60, 90<\/math> triangle, <math>XX' = \\frac{b\\sqrt{3}}{2}<\/math> and <math>BX' = \\frac{b}{2}<\/math>. Thus, <math>D'A = b\\sqrt{2} - \\frac{b}{2}<\/math> and <math>DD' = XX' = \\frac{b\\sqrt{3}}{2}<\/math>. By the Pythagorean Theorem on <math>\\triangle ADD'<\/math>,\n\n<cmath>\\left (b\\sqrt{2} - \\frac{b}{2} \\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{b\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)^2 = \\left(2 - \\sqrt{2} \\right)^2 \\implies b^2 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{10-6\\sqrt{2}}{7}}<\/cmath>.\n\n","Since <math>\\triangle BXN<\/math> is equilateral, let's assume the sides of them are all <math>a<\/math>, and denote the length of <math>XM<\/math> is <math>m<\/math>.

Note that there are 8 ways in which we can arrange two squares differing by 180 degrees. Out of these, each one has two ways to put another square such that two differ by 90 degrees and 1 pair differs by 180.

It increases linearly with a slope of one, then when it reaches the next integer, it repeats itself. We can deduce that the function is like a sawtooth wave, with a period of one. We then analyze the function <math>f(x)=|2\\{x\\}-1|<\/math>. The slope of the teeth is multiplied by 2 to get 2, and the function is moved one unit downward. The function can then be described as starting at -1, moving upward with a slope of 2 to get to 1, and then repeating itself, still with a period of 1. The absolute value of the function is then taken. This results in all the negative segments becoming flipped in the Y direction. The positive slope starting at -1 of the function ranging from <math>u<\/math> to <math>u.5<\/math>, where u is any arbitrary integer, is now a negative slope starting at positive 1.   The function now looks like the letter V repeated within every square in the first row. \n\nIt is now that we address the goal of this, which is to determine how many times the function intersects the line <math>y=x<\/math>. Since there are two line segments per box, the function has two chances to intersect the line <math>y=x<\/math> for every integer. If the height of the function is higher than <math>y=x<\/math> for every integer on an interval, then every chance within that interval intersects the line.  \n\nReturning to analyzing the function, we note that it is multiplied by <math>x<\/math>, and then fed into <math>f(x)<\/math>. Since <math>f(x)<\/math> is a periodic function, we can model it as multiplying the function's frequency by <math>x<\/math>. This gives us <math>2x<\/math> chances for every integer, which is then multiplied by 2 once more to get <math>4x<\/math> chances for every integer.

Also, note that since square <math>PQRS<\/math> lies in the first quadrant, <math>L_1<\/math> and <math>L_2<\/math> must have a positive slope. Using the point-slope form, we can now find the equations of all four lines: <math>L_1: y = m(x-3)<\/math>, <math>L_2: y = m(x-5)<\/math>, <math>L_3: y = -\\frac{1}{m}(x-7)<\/math>, <math>L_4: y = -\\frac{1}{m}(x-13)<\/math>.\n\n\nSince <math>PQRS<\/math> is a square, it follows that <math>\\Delta x<\/math> between points <math>P<\/math> and <math>Q<\/math> is equal to <math>\\Delta y<\/math> between points <math>Q<\/math> and <math>R<\/math>. Our approach will be to find <math>\\Delta x<\/math> and <math>\\Delta y<\/math> in terms of <math>m<\/math> and equate the two to solve for <math>m<\/math>. <math>L_1<\/math> and <math>L_3<\/math> intersect at point <math>P<\/math>. Setting the equations for <math>L_1<\/math> and <math>L_3<\/math> equal to each other and solving for <math>x<\/math>, we find that they intersect at <math>x = \\frac{3m^2 + 7}{m^2 + 1}<\/math>. <math>L_2<\/math> and <math>L_3<\/math> intersect at point <math>Q<\/math>. Intersecting the two equations, the <math>x<\/math>-coordinate of point <math>Q<\/math> is found to be <math>x = \\frac{5m^2 + 7}{m^2 + 1}<\/math>. Subtracting the two, we get <math>\\Delta x = \\frac{2m^2}{m^2 + 1}<\/math>. Substituting the <math>x<\/math>-coordinate for point <math>Q<\/math> found above into the equation for <math>L_2<\/math>, we find that the <math>y<\/math>-coordinate of point <math>Q<\/math> is <math>y = \\frac{2m}{m^2+1}<\/math>. <math>L_2<\/math> and <math>L_4<\/math> intersect at point <math>R<\/math>. Intersecting the two equations, the <math>y<\/math>-coordinate of point <math>R<\/math> is found to be <math>y = \\frac{8m}{m^2 + 1}<\/math>. Subtracting the two, we get <math>\\Delta y = \\frac{6m}{m^2 + 1}<\/math>. Equating <math>\\Delta x<\/math> and <math>\\Delta y<\/math>, we get <math>2m^2 = 6m<\/math> which gives us <math>m = 3<\/math>. Finally, note that the line which goes though the midpoint of <math>P_1<\/math> and <math>P_2<\/math> with slope <math>3<\/math> and the line which goes through the midpoint of <math>P_3<\/math> and <math>P_4<\/math> with slope <math>-\\frac{1}{3}<\/math> must intersect at at the center of the square. The equation of the line going through <math>(4,0)<\/math> is given by <math>y = 3(x-4)<\/math> and the equation of the line going through <math>(10,0)<\/math> is <math>y = -\\frac{1}{3}(x-10)<\/math>. Equating the two, we find that they intersect at <math>(4.6, 1.8)<\/math>. Adding the <math>x<\/math> and <math>y<\/math>-coordinates, we get <math>6.4 = 32\/5<\/math>. Thus, answer choice <math>\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}}<\/math> is correct.\n","\nNote that the center of the square lies along a line that has an <math>x-<\/math>intercept of <math>\\frac{3+5}{2}=4<\/math>, and also along another line with <math>x-<\/math>intercept <math>\\frac{7+13}{2}=10<\/math>. Since these 2 lines are parallel to the sides of the square, they are perpendicular (since the sides of a square are). Let <math>m<\/math> be the slope of the first line. Then <math>-\\frac{1}{m}<\/math> is the slope of the second line. We may use the point-slope form for the equation of a line to write <math>l_1:y=m(x-4)<\/math> and <math>l_2:y=-\\frac{1}{m}(x-10)<\/math>. We easily calculate the intersection of these lines using substitution or elimination to obtain <math>\\left(\\frac{4m^2+10}{m^2+1},\\frac{6m}{m^2+1}\\right)<\/math> as the center or the square. Let <math>\\theta<\/math> denote the (acute) angle formed by <math>l_1<\/math> and the <math>x-<\/math>axis. Note that <math>\\tan\\theta=m<\/math>. Let <math>s<\/math> denote the side length of the square. Then <math>\\sin\\theta=s\/2<\/math>. On the other hand the acute angle formed by <math>l_2<\/math> and the <math>x-<\/math>axis is <math>90-\\theta<\/math> so that <math>\\cos\\theta=\\sin(90-\\theta)=s\/6<\/math>. Then <math>m=\\tan\\theta=3<\/math>. Substituting into <math>\\left(\\frac{4m^2+10}{m^2+1},\\frac{6m}{m^2+1}\\right)<\/math> we obtain <math>\\left(\\frac{23}{5},\\frac{9}{5}\\right)<\/math> so that the sum of the coordinates is <math>\\frac{32}{5}=6.4<\/math>.

Setting <math>6\\sin\\theta=-2\\cos\\theta<\/math>, we get that <math>\\tan\\theta=-1\/3<\/math>. This means <math>-1\/3<\/math> is the slope of line <math>PQ<\/math>\n\nand the lines parallel to it. This is good news because we are dealing with easy numbers. We can solve for the coordinates of \n\npoints <math>E<\/math> and <math>F<\/math> because they are the midpoints.

See this link: [http:\/\/math.stackexchange.com\/questions\/4323\/are-all-algebraic-integers-with-absolute-value-1-roots-of-unity]). Since <math>P<\/math> has degree 4, it seems reasonable (and we will assume this only temporarily) that <math>z_0<\/math> must be a 2nd, 3rd, or 4th root of unity. These are among the set <math>\\{\\pm1,\\pm i,(-1\\pm i\\sqrt{3})\/2\\}<\/math>. Since complex roots of polynomials come in conjugate pairs, we have that <math>P<\/math> has one (or more) of the following factors: <math>z+1<\/math>, <math>z-1<\/math>, <math>z^2+1<\/math>, or <math>z^2+z+1<\/math>. If <math>z=1<\/math> then <math>a+b+c+d+4=0<\/math>; a contradiction since <math>a,b,c,d<\/math> are non-negative. On the other hand, suppose <math>z=-1<\/math>. Then <math>(a+c)-(b+d)=4<\/math>. This implies <math>a+b=8,7,6,5,4<\/math> while <math>b+d=4,3,2,1,0<\/math> correspondingly. After listing cases, the only such valid <math>a,b,c,d<\/math> are <math>4,4,4,0<\/math>, <math>4,3,3,0<\/math>, <math>4,2,2,0<\/math>, <math>4,1,1,0<\/math>, and <math>4,0,0,0<\/math>. \n\nNow suppose <math>z=i<\/math>. Then <math>4=(a-c)i+(b-d)<\/math> whereupon <math>a=c<\/math> and <math>b-d=4<\/math>. But then <math>a=b=c<\/math> and <math>d=a-4<\/math>. This gives only the cases <math>a,b,c,d<\/math> equals <math>4,4,4,0<\/math>, which we have already counted in a previous case.\n\nSuppose <math>z=-i<\/math>.

Using polynomial division ((or that <math>z^3=1<\/math> to make the same deductions) we ultimately obtain that <math>b=4+c<\/math>.

Note that this polynomial has a 5th root of unity as a root. We will show that we were \\textit{almost} correct in our initial assumption; that is that <math>z_0<\/math> is at most a 5th root of unity, and that the last polynomial we obtained is the last polynomial with the given properties. Suppose that <math>z_0<\/math> in an <math>n<\/math>th root of unity where <math>n>5<\/math>, and <math>z_0<\/math> is not a 3rd or 4th root of unity.

If <math>n<\/math> is prime, then \\textit{every} <math>n<\/math>th root of unity except 1 must satisfy our polynomial, but since <math>n>5<\/math> and the degree of our polynomial is 4, this is impossible. Suppose <math>n<\/math> is composite. If it has a prime factor <math>p<\/math> greater than 5 then again every <math>p<\/math>th root of unity must satisfy our polynomial and we arrive at the same contradiction. Therefore suppose <math>n<\/math> is divisible only by 2,3,or 5. Since by hypothesis <math>z_0<\/math> is not a 2nd or 3rd root of unity, <math>z_0<\/math> must be a 5th root of unity. Since 5 is prime, every 5th root of unity except 1 must satisfy our polynomial. That is, the other 4 complex 5th roots of unity must satisfy <math>P(z_0)=0<\/math>. But <math>(x^5-1)\/(x-1)<\/math> has exactly all 5th roots of unity excluding 1, and <math>(x^5-1)\/(x-1)=x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1<\/math>.

However, <math>da \\leq 4c<\/math>, therefore <math>da-4c=0<\/math>. This is true only when <math>d=c<\/math>. Also, we get <math>k=0<\/math> again.

Now we consider the root <math>z_0<\/math> with <math>|z_0|=1<\/math>. <math>|4z_0^5| = 4<\/math>, so the right hand side must have absolute value 4.

If <math>d \\neq 0<\/math>, then <math>4z_0^5<\/math> must be real by the previous argument, so <math>z_0<\/math> is a fifth root of unity.

If <math>z_0<\/math> is also a second root of unity, <math>(4-a)z_0^3<\/math> and <math>(b-c)z_0<\/math> must be zero but <math>(a-b)z_0^2<\/math> can be anything.

It eventually met the raft on the river 9 hours after leaving dock <math>A.<\/math> How many hours did it take the power boat to go from <math>A<\/math> to <math>B?<\/math>","solution":["\n=== Solution 1 ===\n\nWLOG let the speed of the river be 0. This is allowed because the problem never states that the speed of the current has to have a magnitude greater than 0. In this case, when the powerboat travels from <math>A<\/math> to <math>B<\/math>, the raft remains at <math>A<\/math>. Thus the trip from <math>A<\/math> to <math>B<\/math> takes the same time as the trip from <math>B<\/math> to the raft. Since these times are equal and sum to <math>9<\/math> hours, the trip from <math>A<\/math> to <math>B<\/math> must take half this time, or <math>4.5<\/math> hours. The answer is thus <math>\\boxed{\\textbf{D}}<\/math>.\n\nRemark: This is equivalent to viewing the problem from the raft's perspective.\n\n=== Solution 2 ===\n\nWhat's important in this problem is to consider everything in terms of the power boat and the raft, since that is how the problem is given to us. Think of the blue arrow as the power boat and the red arrow as the raft in the following three diagrams, which represent different time intervals of the problem.\n\n<asy>\nsize(8cm,8cm);\npair A, B;\nA=(-3,4);\nB=(3,4);\ndraw(A--B);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\narrow((-2.5,6.4),dir(180),blue);\narrow((-2.5,6.2),dir(180),red);\npair A, B;\nA=(-3,5);\nB=(3,5);\ndraw(A--B);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\narrow((2.6,5.4),dir(360),blue);\narrow((-0.5,5.2),dir(180),red);\npair A, B;\nA=(-3,6);\nB=(3,6);\ndraw(A--B);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\narrow((.3,4.4),dir(360),blue);\narrow((1.1,4.2),dir(180),red);<\/asy>\n\nThinking about the distance covered as their distances with respect to each other, they are <math>0<\/math> distance apart in the first diagram when they haven't started to move yet, some distance <math>d<\/math> apart in the second diagram when the power boat reaches <math>B<\/math>, and again <math>0<\/math> distance apart in the third diagram when they meet. Therefore, with respect to each other, the boat and the raft cover a distance of <math>d<\/math> on the way there, and again cover a distance of <math>d<\/math> on when drawing closer. This makes sense, because from the 1st diagram to the second, the raft moves in the same direction as the boat, while from the 2nd to the 3rd, the boat and raft move in opposite directions.\n\nLet <math>b<\/math> denote the speed of the power boat (only the power boat, not factoring in current) and <math>r<\/math> denote the speed of the raft, which, as given by the problem, is also equal to the speed of the current. Thus, from <math>A<\/math> to <math>B<\/math>, the boat travels at a velocity of <math>b+r<\/math>, and on the way back, travels at a velocity of <math>-(b-r)=r-b<\/math>, since the current aids the boat on the way there, and goes against the boat on the way back. With respect to the raft then, the boat's velocity from <math>A<\/math> to <math>B<\/math> becomes <math>(r+b)-r=b<\/math>, and on the way back it becomes <math>(r-b)-r=-b<\/math>. Since the boat's velocities with respect to the raft are exact opposites, <math>b<\/math> and <math>-b<\/math>, we therefore know that the boat and raft travel apart from each other at the same rate that they travel toward each other.\n\nFrom this, we have that the boat travels a distance <math>d<\/math> at rate <math>b<\/math> with respect to the raft both on the way to <math>B<\/math> and on the way back. Thus, using <math>\\dfrac{distance}{speed}=time<\/math>, we have <math>\\dfrac{2d}{b}=9\\text{ hours}<\/math>, and to see how long it took to travel half the distance, we have <math>\\dfrac{d}{b}=4.5\\text{ hours}\\implies\\boxed{\\textbf{D}}<\/math>\n\n=== Solution 3 ===\n\nLet <math>t<\/math> be the time it takes the power boat to go from <math>A<\/math> to <math>B<\/math> in hours, <math>r<\/math> be the speed of the river current (and thus also the raft), and <math>p<\/math> to be the speed of the power boat with respect to the river. \n\nUsing <math>d = rt<\/math>, the raft covers a distance of <math>9r<\/math>, the distance from <math>A<\/math> to <math>B<\/math> is <math>(p + r)t<\/math>, and the distance from <math>B<\/math> to where the raft and power boat met up is <math>(9 - t)(p - r)<\/math>. \n\nThen, <math>9r + (9 - t)(p - r) = (p + r)t<\/math>.

Points that are <math>60<\/math>-ray partitional are of the form <math>\\left(\\frac{m}{30}s, \\frac{n}{30}s\\right)<\/math>, where <math>m<\/math> and <math>n<\/math> are also positive integers. We count the number of points <math>\\left(\\frac{d}{50}s, \\frac{a}{50}s\\right)<\/math> that can also be written in this form. For a given <math>d<\/math>, <math>\\frac{d}{50}=\\frac{m}{30}<\/math> if and only if <math>m=\\frac{3}{5}d<\/math>, and likewise with <math>a<\/math> and <math>n<\/math>. We can then see that a point is both <math>100<\/math>-ray partitional and <math>60<\/math>-ray partitional if and only if <math>a<\/math> and <math>d<\/math> are both divisible by <math>5<\/math>. There are <math>9<\/math> integers between <math>1<\/math> and <math>49<\/math> that are divisible by <math>5<\/math>, so out of our <math>2401<\/math> points that are <math>100<\/math>-ray partitional, <math>9\\times 9=81<\/math> are also <math>60<\/math>-ray partitional.\n\n\nOur answer then is just <math>2401-81=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2320}<\/math>.\n","For the sake of simplicity, let <math>R<\/math> be a <math>60 \\times 60<\/math> square and set the bottom-left point as the origin.

If it is on the bottom side, then the height must be <math>y<\/math>. So, the base of each triangle must be <math>\\frac{72}{y}.<\/math> So, there will be <math>\\frac{60}{\\frac{72}{y}} = \\frac{60y}{72}<\/math> total triangles on that side.\n\nIf the triangle is on the right side of the square, then the height has to be <math>60 - x.<\/math> So, the base will be <math>\\frac{72}{60-x}<\/math> and there will be <math>\\frac{60 (60-x)}{72}<\/math> triangles.\n\nIf the triangle is on the top, the height will be <math>60-y<\/math>, the base will be <math>\\frac{72}{60-y}<\/math> and there will be <math>\\frac{60 (60-y)}{72}<\/math> triangles along this side.\n\nThe triangles on the left will have height <math>x<\/math>, base <math>\\frac{72}{x}<\/math> and <math>\\frac{60x}{72}<\/math> such triangles must exist. \n\nSimplifying, we get <math>\\frac{5y}{6}, \\frac{5 (60-x)}{6}, \\frac{5(60-y)}{6}, \\frac{5x}{6}<\/math> triangles on the respective sides of the square. \n\nAll of these numbers must be integers.

This means <math>a<\/math> and <math>b<\/math> have to be of the form <math>\\frac{y}{30}<\/math> where <math>0<y<30.<\/math>\n\nIf a point is both <math>100<\/math>-ray partitional and <math>60<\/math>-ray partitional, then it can be written as <cmath>\\frac{x}{50} =  \\frac{y}{30}<\/cmath>. Note that whenever <math>x<\/math> is divisible by <math>5<\/math>, a <math>y<\/math> will always exist to satisfy the above equation.\n\nSo, <math>x<\/math> has to be in the range <math>(0, 50)<\/math> and must be divisible by <math>5<\/math>. There are <math>9<\/math> possibilities, namely <math>5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45.<\/math> \n\nThe <math>x<\/math>-coordinate of the point and the <math>y<\/math>-coordinate of the point can each use any of these <math>9<\/math> possibilities, giving <math>9^2 = 81<\/math> numbers that are both <math>100<\/math>-ray partitional and <math>60<\/math>-ray partitional.\n\nOverall, we are left with <math>2401 - 81 = \\boxed{2320}<\/math> solutions.\n"]},{"problem":"Let <math>f(z)= \\frac{z+a}{z+b}<\/math> and <math>g(z)=f(f(z))<\/math>, where <math>a<\/math> and <math>b<\/math> are complex numbers.

The bug can start the \"detour\" from any point on or inside the rectangle. Notice that the bug can go 5 steps in the y direction, 5 steps in the x direction, or anything in between, so the points covered by possible detours from any point would look like a rhombus or square rotated 45 degrees (with centre at a point on or inside the rectangle).

How many different convex cyclic quadrilaterals are there with integer sides and perimeter equal to 32?","solution":["It should first be noted that given any quadrilateral of fixed side lengths, there is exactly one way to manipulate the angles so that the quadrilateral becomes cyclic.\n\n'''Proof.''' Given a quadrilateral <math>ABCD<\/math> where all sides are fixed (in a certain order), we can construct the diagonal <math>\\overline{BD}<\/math>. When <math>BD<\/math> is the minimum allowed by the triangle inequality, one of the angles <math>\\angle DAB<\/math> or <math>\\angle BCD<\/math> will be degenerate and measure <math>0^\\circ<\/math>, so opposite angles will sum to less than <math>180^\\circ<\/math>. When <math>BD<\/math> is the maximum allowed, one of the angles will be degenerate and measure <math>180^\\circ<\/math>, so opposite angles will sum to more than <math>180^\\circ<\/math>. Thus, since the sum of opposite angles increases continuously as <math>BD<\/math> is lengthened from the minimum to the maximum values, there is a unique value of <math>BD<\/math> somewhere in the middle such that the sum of opposite angles is exactly <math>180^\\circ<\/math>.\n\nDenote <math>a<\/math>, <math>b<\/math>, <math>c<\/math>, and <math>d<\/math> as the integer side lengths of the quadrilateral. Without loss of generality, let <math>a\\ge b \\ge c \\ge d<\/math>.\n\nSince <math>a+b+c+d = 32<\/math>, the [[Triangle Inequality]] implies that <math>a \\le 15<\/math>.\n\n\nWe will now split into <math>5<\/math> cases.\n\n\nCase <math>1<\/math>: <math>a = b = c = d<\/math> (<math>4<\/math> side lengths are equal)\n\nClearly there is only <math>1<\/math> way to select the side lengths <math>(8,8,8,8)<\/math>, and no matter how the sides are rearranged only <math>1<\/math> unique quadrilateral can be formed.\n\nCase <math>2<\/math>: <math>a = b = c > d<\/math> or <math>a > b = c = d<\/math> (<math>3<\/math> side lengths are equal)\n\nIf <math>3<\/math> side lengths are equal, then each of those side lengths can only be integers from <math>6<\/math> to <math>10<\/math> except for <math>8<\/math> (because that is counted in the first case). Obviously there is still only <math>1<\/math> unique quadrilateral that can be formed from one set of side lengths, resulting in a total of <math>4<\/math> quadrilaterals.\n\nCase <math>3<\/math>: <math>a = b > c = d<\/math> (<math>2<\/math> pairs of side lengths are equal)\n\n<math>a<\/math> and <math>b<\/math> can be any integer from <math>9<\/math> to <math>15<\/math>, and likewise <math>c<\/math> and <math>d<\/math> can be any integer from <math>1<\/math> to <math>7<\/math>. However, a single set of side lengths can form <math>2<\/math> different cyclic quadrilaterals (a rectangle and a kite), so the total number of quadrilaterals for this case is <math>7\\cdot{2} = 14<\/math>.\n\nCase <math>4<\/math>: <math>a = b > c > d<\/math> or <math>a > b = c > d<\/math> or <math>a > b > c = d<\/math> (<math>2<\/math> side lengths are equal)\n\nIf the <math>2<\/math> equal side lengths are each <math>1<\/math>, then the other <math>2<\/math> sides must each be <math>15<\/math>, which we have already counted in an earlier case. If the equal side lengths are each <math>2<\/math>, there is <math>1<\/math> possible set of side lengths. Likewise, for side lengths of <math>3<\/math> there are <math>2<\/math> sets. Continuing this pattern, we find a total of <math>1+2+3+4+4+5+7+5+4+4+3+2+1 = 45<\/math> sets of side lengths. (Be VERY careful when adding up the total for this case!) For each set of side lengths, there are <math>3<\/math> possible quadrilaterals that can be formed, so the total number of quadrilaterals for this case is <math>3\\cdot{45} = 135<\/math>.\n\nCase <math>5<\/math>: <math>a > b > c > d<\/math> (no side lengths are equal)\nUsing the same counting principles starting from <math>a = 15<\/math> and eventually reaching <math>a = 9<\/math>, we find that the total number of possible side lengths is <math>69<\/math>.

The total number of quadrilaterals is <math>6\\cdot{69} = 414<\/math>.\n\n\nAnd so, the total number of quadrilaterals that can be made is <math>414 + 135 + 14 + 4 + 1 = \\boxed{568\\ \\textbf{(C)}}<\/math>.\n","As with solution <math>1<\/math> we would  like to note that given any quadrilateral we can change its angles to make a cyclic one.\n\nLet <math>a \\ge b \\ge c\\ge d<\/math> be the sides of the quadrilateral.\n\nThere are <math>\\binom{31}{3}<\/math> ways to partition <math>32<\/math>. However, some of these will not be quadrilaterals since they would have one side bigger than the sum of the other three.  This occurs when <math>a \\ge 16<\/math>.  For <math>a=16<\/math>, <math>b+c+d=16<\/math>. There are <math>\\binom{15}{2}<\/math> ways to partition <math>16<\/math>.

We then account for symmetry. If all sides are congruent (meaning the quadrilateral is a square), the quadrilateral will be counted once. If the quadrilateral is a rectangle (and not a square), it will be counted twice. In all other cases, it will be counted 4 times. Since there is <math>1<\/math> square case, and <math>7<\/math> rectangle cases, there are <math>2255-1-2\\cdot7=2240<\/math> quadrilaterals counted 4 times.

Without loss of generality, assume that <math>A,B,C,D<\/math> are in the first, second, third, fourth quadrant. Then we consider the following mapping:\n\n<cmath>A \\to A' = A<\/cmath>\n<cmath>B \\to B' = B + (10,0)<\/cmath>\n<cmath>C \\to C' = C + (10,10)<\/cmath>\n<cmath>D \\to D' = D + (0,10)<\/cmath>\n\nThen the new points <math>A'<\/math>, <math>B'<\/math>, <math>C'<\/math>, <math>D'<\/math> are either being the same point or forming a square in <math>G_1 = G \\cap \\{ x>0, y>0 \\}<\/math>, a 5x5 grid. \n\nConversely, for any point in <math>G_1<\/math>, it can be reversed to a square <math>ABCD<\/math>; however, for any square in <math>G_1<\/math>, there are four possible squares <math>ABCD<\/math> that were mapped to them. Therefore the number of possible squares <math>ABCD<\/math> is equal to <math>25 + 4N<\/math>, where <math>N<\/math> is the number of squares inscribed in <math>G_1<\/math>.\n\nMoreover by the same idea in solution 1, each square (with sides parallel or slanted to the axes) in a <math>G_1<\/math> can be inscribed in a square in <math>G_1<\/math>, with sides parallel to one of the axes, call it \"standard square\". Noticing that each standard square of side length <math>a<\/math> corresponds to <math>a<\/math> inscribed squares,  and that there are <math>(5-a)^2<\/math> number of standard squares of side length <math>a<\/math>, we have\n\n<cmath>N = \\sum_{a=1}^{4} a(5-a)^2 = 1\\cdot 16 + 2\\cdot 9 + 3 \\cdot 4 + 4 \\cdot 1 = 16+18+12+4=50<\/cmath>\n\nSo the answer is <math>25+4\\cdot 50 = 225<\/math>\n\nMotivation(by williamgolly, solution by MAA):\nHomotheties\n","Start with Solution 2: the number of possible squares <math>ABCD<\/math> is equal to <math>25 + 4N<\/math>. Notice there are only 2 options (<math>A<\/math>, and <math>E<\/math>) which have integer solutions for N. Option <math>A<\/math> corresponds to <math>N=25<\/math>, and option <math>E<\/math> corresponds to <math>N=50<\/math>. At this point, guessing between the 2 choices is already worth it, but there are already 16 unit squares (solutions to N), meaning that the answer is more probably <math>E<\/math>.\n\nEdit:There are 125 squares you can make w\/out tilted ones, so the answer is more than 125, hence <math>E<\/math>.\n","Consider any square that meets the requirements described in the problem.

Trying this out with a couple of other squares, we see that the following property holds:\n\n<cmath>\\text{\"For any and all squares with vertices in each of the four quadrants, the 'mapped' version is also a square.\"}<\/cmath>\n\n\nTherefore the logical inverse is true:\n\n\n<cmath>\\text{\"For any 'mapped' square with all four vertices in the first quadrant,}<\/cmath>\n<cmath>\\text{there exists at least one corresponding 'unmapped' square with a vertex in each of the four quadrants.\"}<\/cmath>\n\n\nBut how many \"unmapped\" squares, to be exact? \n\n\nThis might seem complicated at first, but with some intuitive thinking, we realize that there are exactly <math>4<\/math> \"unmapped\" squares that correspond with a \"mapped\" square. This is because given a \"mapped\" square, there are <math>4<\/math> choices for the vertex that will remain in the first quadrant; but once that point is chosen, there is only <math>1<\/math> distribution of the other <math>3<\/math> vertices that will result in a square. So, we want four times the number of squares we can make in the first quadrant grid.\n\n\nWe divide our counting method into two cases: squares with side length <math>0<\/math> after mapping (which means all four vertices are in the same position relative to their own grids) and squares with side length <math>1-4<\/math> after mapping.\n\n\nCase 1: There are <math>25<\/math> such squares of length <math>0<\/math> (this is equivalent to counting the number of points on the grid). However, in this scenario, all of the vertices have been mapped onto the same point. So instead of <math>4<\/math> choices for the first quadrant vertex, there is only one. Subsequently there are  only <math>25<\/math> such squares that correspond to them.\n\n\nCase 2: Let a square with sides parallel to the axes be known as <math>A<\/math> squares. These <math>A<\/math> squares can have side length <math>1, 2, 3,<\/math> or <math>4<\/math>. However, the number of <math>A<\/math> squares possible depends on the side length. For example, there is only <math>1<\/math> possible <math>A<\/math> square of side length <math>4<\/math>, but <math>16<\/math> squares of side length <math>1<\/math>. To be exact, there are <math>(5-s)^2<\/math> possible <math>A<\/math> squares of side length <math>s<\/math>. So, the total number of <math>A<\/math> squares is\n\n\n<math>\\sum_{s=1}^4 (5-s)^2<\/math>\n\n\nBut what about \"tilted\" squares? Notice that \"tilted squares\" can always be inscribed (drawn within) another, bigger square. Let a square inscribed within an <math>A<\/math> square be called a <math>B<\/math> square. How many <math>B<\/math> squares are there? Well, this also depends on the side length. We only want squares whose vertices are lattice points (integer value coordinates), so the number of <math>B<\/math> squares should increase along with side length. We defined <math>B<\/math> squares to be inscribed within <math>A<\/math> squares, so we can say that all <math>B<\/math> squares have their vertices on the side on an <math>A<\/math> square. Consider an <math>A<\/math> square with side length <math>4<\/math>. There are <math>3<\/math> other lattice points along the side of the <math>A<\/math> square, not counting the vertices. Therefore, we can say that there are <math>s-1<\/math> possible <math>B<\/math> squares for every <math>A<\/math> square with side length <math>s<\/math>. We can multiply <math>(s-1)<\/math> times the number of <math>A<\/math> squares to get the number of <math>B<\/math> squares. This is \n\n\n<math>\\sum_{s=1}^4 (s-1)(5-s)^2<\/math>\n\n\ntotal <math>B<\/math> squares.

Multiplying this by <math>4<\/math> to get the corresponding number of \"unmapped\" squares, then adding to get the number of squares for Case 1, we get\n\n\n<math>50*4 + 25 = 225 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\text{E}}<\/math>.\n"]},{"problem":"A bakery owner turns on his doughnut machine at <math>\\text{8:30}\\ {\\small\\text{AM}}<\/math>.

Also, throughout the solution refer to the graph in solution 1 to understand this one more. Lets first start off by defining the position function for Michael. We let <math>M(t) = 5t<\/math>, where <math>t<\/math> is the amount of seconds passed. Now, lets define the position function of the truck as two independent functions. It is obvious, graphically, that the position function of the truck is a piecewise function alternating between linear lines and constant lines. Lets focus on the linear pieces of the truck's position function. Let the <math>kth<\/math> linear part of the truck's position function be denoted as <math>L_k(t)<\/math>. Then through algebra, it is found that <math>L_k(t) = 10t +  500 - 300k<\/math>, <math>{50k - 50 <= t <= 50k - 30}<\/math>. Now, lets move on to the constant pieces, which is a lot easier in terms of algebra. Let the <math>ith<\/math> constant part of the truck's position function be denoted as <math>C_i(t)<\/math>. Then, again, through algebra we obtain <math>C_i(t) = 200 * (i + 1)<\/math>, <math>{50i - 30 <= t <= 50i}<\/math>. Now, let me stress that <math>i<\/math> and <math>k<\/math> are disjoint, which is why I used different variable names. We are interested in where  <math>C_i(t)<\/math> and <math>L_k(t)<\/math> intersect <math>M(t)<\/math> or <math>5t<\/math>. <math>L_k(t)<\/math> intersects <math>M<\/math> at <math>(60k - 100, 300k - 500)<\/math>. However, the only <math>k<\/math> values that actually work are <math>5 <= k <= 7<\/math> because of the domain restrictions on <math>L_k(t)<\/math>. Similarly, we also see that for <math>C_i(t)<\/math> it intersects at <math>(40i + 40, 200i + 200)<\/math>. The only <math>i<\/math> values that work is <math>4 <= i <= 7<\/math>. However, some pair <math>(i, k)<\/math> might yield the same exact intersection point. Checking this through simple algebra we see that <math>(4,5)<\/math> and <math>(7,7)<\/math> do indeed yield the same intersection point. Thus, our answer is <math>(7 - 5 + 1) + (7 - 4 + 1) - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5<\/math> or <math>\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}}<\/math>.\n\nNote: This is probably not the best solution as it seems a lot more tedious, but it still works.

Two, that since this is symmetric, we can just focus on the first half as the ratio of valid to total is the same. We see that the rectangle has a height of <math>2<\/math> and a width of <math>1<\/math>, thus its area is 2. The triangle's height is <math>2-\\sqrt3<\/math>, and its width is the same thus its area is <math>(2-\\sqrt3)^2\/2<\/math> => <math>(7-4\\sqrt3)\/2<\/math>.

The only positive integers <math>n<\/math> that satisfy the condition are perfect multiples of <math>3<\/math>.\n\nProof of claim:\nWe examine the positive integers mod <math>9<\/math>. Here are the cases.\n\nCase 1. <math>n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9<\/math>. Now, we examine <math>S(n)<\/math> modulo <math>9<\/math>.\nCase 1.1. The tens digit of <math>n<\/math> is different from the tens digit of the largest multiple of <math>9<\/math> under <math>n<\/math>. (In other words, this means we will carry when adding from the perfect multiple of <math>9<\/math> under <math>n<\/math>.)\nObserve that when we carry, i.e. Add <math>1<\/math> onto <math>1989<\/math> to obtain <math>1990<\/math>, the units digit decreases by <math>9<\/math> while the tens digit increases by <math>1<\/math>. This means that the sum of the digits decreases by <math>8<\/math> in total, and we have <math>-8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9<\/math>, so the \"mod 9\" of the sum increases by <math>1<\/math>. This means that, regardless of whether the sum carries or not, the modulo 9 of the sum of the digits always increases by <math>1<\/math>.\n\nCase 1.2. The tens digits are the same, which is trivial since the units digit just increases by <math>1<\/math> which means that the sum is also equivalent to <math>1 \\pmod 9<\/math>.\n\nThis means that <math>S(n) \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9<\/math> and similarly letting the next <math>n=S(n)<\/math>, <math>S(S(n)) \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9<\/math>. Summing these, we have <math>n+S(n)+S(S(n)) \\equiv 3 \\pmod 9<\/math>. Clearly, no integers of this form will satisfy the condition because <math>2007<\/math> is a perfect multiple of <math>9<\/math>.\n\nCase 2. <math>n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 9<\/math>.\n\nIn this case, we apply exactly the same argument. There is at most one carry, which means that the sum of the digits will always be congruent to <math>2<\/math> mod <math>9<\/math>. Then we can apply similar arguments to get <math>S(n) \\equiv 2 \\pmod 9<\/math> and <math>S(S(n)) \\equiv 2 \\pmod 9<\/math>, so adding gives <math>n+S(n)+S(S(n)) \\equiv 6 \\pmod 9<\/math>.\n\nIt is trivial to see that for <math>n \\equiv k \\pmod 9<\/math>, for <math>0 \\leq k \\leq 8<\/math>, we must have <math>n+S(n)+S(S(n)) \\equiv 3k \\pmod 9<\/math>. Only when <math>k=0, 3, 6<\/math> is <math>3k<\/math> a multiple of <math>9<\/math>, which means that <math>n<\/math> must be a multiple of <math>3<\/math>.\n\nNow, we find the integers. Again, consider two cases: Integers that are direct multiples of <math>9<\/math> and integers that are multiples of <math>3<\/math> but not <math>9<\/math>.\n\nCase 1. <math>n<\/math> is a multiple of <math>9<\/math>. An integer of the form <math>\\overline{20ab}<\/math> will not work since the least such integer is <math>2007<\/math> which already exceeds our bounds. Thus, we need only consider the integers of the form <math>\\overline{19ab}<\/math>. The valid sums of the digits of <math>n<\/math> are <math>18<\/math> and <math>27<\/math> in this case.\n\nCase 1.1. The sum of the digits is <math>18<\/math>. This means that <math>S(n)=18, S(S(n))=9<\/math>, so <math>n=2007-18-9=1980<\/math>. Clearly this number satisfies our constraints.\n\nCase 1.2. The sum of the digits is <math>27<\/math>. This means that <math>S(n)=27, S(S(n))=9<\/math>, ,so <math>n=2007-27-9=1971<\/math>. Since the sum of the digits of <math>1971<\/math> is not <math>27<\/math>, this does not work.\n\nThis means that there is <math>1<\/math> integer in this case.\n\nCase 2. <math>n<\/math> is a multiple of <math>3<\/math>, not <math>9<\/math>.\n.\nCase 2.1. Integers of the form <math>\\overline{20ab}<\/math>. Then <math>S(n)=3<\/math> or <math>S(n)=6<\/math>; it is trivial to see that <math>S(n)=6<\/math> exceeds our bounds, so <math>S(n)=3<\/math> and <math>n=2007-6=2001<\/math>.\n\nCase 2.2. Integers of the form <math>\\overline{19ab}<\/math>. Then <math>S(n)=12, 15, 21, 24<\/math> and we consider each case separately.\n\nCase 2.2.1. Integers with <math>S(n)=12<\/math>. That means <math>n=2007-12-3=1992<\/math> which clearly does not work.\n\nCase 2.2.2. Integers with <math>S(n)=15<\/math>. That means <math>n=2007-15-6=1986<\/math> which also does not work\n\nCase 2.2.3. Integers with <math>S(n)=21<\/math>. That means <math>n=2007-21-3=1983<\/math> which is valid.\n\nCase 2.2.4. Integers with <math>S(n)=24<\/math>. That means <math>n=2007-24-6=1977<\/math> which is also valid.\n\nWe have considered every case, so there are <math>\\boxed{4}<\/math> integers that satisfy the given condition.\n\n~Refined by HamstPan38825\n","Let the number of digits of <math>n<\/math> be <math>m<\/math>. If <math>m = 5<\/math>, <math>n<\/math> will already be greater than <math>2007<\/math>. Notice that <math>S(n)<\/math> is always at most <math>9m<\/math>. Then if <math>m = 3<\/math>, <math>n<\/math> will be at most <math>999<\/math>, <math>S(n)<\/math> will be at most <math>27<\/math>, and <math>S(S(n))<\/math> will be even smaller than <math>27<\/math>. Clearly we cannot reach a sum of <math>2007<\/math>, unless <math>m = 4<\/math> (i.e. <math>n<\/math> has <math>4<\/math> digits).\n\nThen, let <math>n<\/math> be a four digit number in the form <math>1000a + 100b + 10c + d<\/math>. Then <math>S(n) = a + b + c + d<\/math>.\n\n<math>S(S(n))<\/math> is the sum of the digits of <math>a + b + c + d<\/math>. We can represent <math>S(S(n))<\/math> as the sum of the tens digit and the ones digit of <math>S(n)<\/math>. The tens digit in the form of a decimal is\n\n\n<math>\\frac{a + b + c + d}{10}<\/math>.\n\n\nTo remove the decimal portion, we can simply take the floor of the expression,\n\n\n<math>\\lfloor\\frac{a + b + c + d}{10}\\rfloor<\/math>.\n\n\nNow that we have expressed the tens digit, we can express the ones digit as <math>S(S(n)) -10<\/math> times the above expression, or\n\n\n<math>a + b + c + d - 10\\lfloor\\frac{a + b + c + d}{10}\\rfloor<\/math>.\n\n\nAdding the two expressions yields the value of <math>S(S(n))<\/math>\n\n\n<math> = a + b + c + d - 9\\lfloor\\frac{a + b + c + d}{10}\\rfloor<\/math>.\n\n\nCombining this expression to the ones for <math>n<\/math> and <math>S(n)<\/math> yields\n\n\n<math>1002a + 102b + 12c + 3d - 9\\lfloor\\frac{a + b + c + d}{10}\\rfloor<\/math>.\n\n\nSetting this equal to <math>2007<\/math> and rearranging a bit yields\n\n\n<math>12c + 3d = 2007 - 1002a - 102b + 9\\lfloor\\frac{a + b + c + d}{10}\\rfloor<\/math>\n\n<math>\\Rightarrow<\/math> <math>4c + d = 669 - 334a - 34b + 3\\lfloor\\frac{a + b + c + d}{10}\\rfloor<\/math>.\n\n\n(The reason for this slightly weird arrangement will soon become evident)\n\n\nNow we examine the possible values of <math>a<\/math>. If <math>a \\ge 3<\/math>, <math>n<\/math> is already too large. <math>a<\/math> must also be greater than <math>0<\/math>, or <math>n<\/math> would be a <math>3<\/math>-digit number. Therefore, <math>a = 1 \\, \\text{or} \\, 2<\/math>. Now we examine by case.\n\nIf <math>a = 2<\/math>, then <math>b<\/math> and <math>c<\/math> must both be <math>0<\/math> (otherwise <math>n<\/math> would already be greater than <math>2007<\/math>). Substituting these values into the equation yields\n\n\n<math>d = 1 + 3\\lfloor\\frac{2 + d}{10}\\rfloor<\/math>\n\n<math>\\Rightarrow<\/math> <math>d=1<\/math>.\n\n\nSure enough, <math>2001 + (2+1) + 3=2007<\/math>.\n\nNow we move onto the case where <math>a = 1<\/math>. Then our initial equation simplifies to\n\n\n<math>4c + d = 335 - 34b + 3\\lfloor\\frac{1 + b + c + d}{10}\\rfloor<\/math>\n\n\nSince <math>c<\/math> and <math>d<\/math> can each be at most <math>9<\/math>, we substitute that value to find the lower bound of <math>b<\/math>. Doing so yields\n\n\n<math>34b \\ge 290 + 3\\lfloor\\frac{19 + b}{10}\\rfloor<\/math>.\n\n\nThe floor expression is at least <math>3\\lfloor\\frac{19}{10}\\rfloor=3<\/math> , so the right-hand side is at least <math>293<\/math>. Solving for <math>b<\/math>, we see that <math>b \\ge 9 <\/math> <math>\\Rightarrow<\/math> <math>b=9<\/math>. Again, we substitute for <math>b<\/math> and the equation becomes\n\n\n<math>4c + d = 29 + 3\\lfloor\\frac{10 + c + d}{10}\\rfloor<\/math>\n\n<math>\\Rightarrow<\/math> <math>4c + d = 32 + 3\\lfloor\\frac{c + d}{10}\\rfloor<\/math>.\n\n\nJust like we did for <math>b<\/math>, we can find the lower bound of <math>c<\/math> by assuming <math>d = 9<\/math> and solving:\n\n\n<math>4c + 9 \\ge 29 + 3\\lfloor\\frac{c + 9}{10}\\rfloor<\/math>\n\n<math>\\Rightarrow<\/math> <math>4c \\ge 20 + 3\\lfloor\\frac{c + 9}{10}\\rfloor<\/math>\n\n\nThe right hand side is <math>20<\/math> for <math>c=0<\/math> and <math>23<\/math> for <math>c \\ge 1<\/math>. Solving for c yields <math>c \\ge 6<\/math>. Looking back at the previous equation, the floor expression is <math>0<\/math> for <math>c+d \\le 9<\/math> and <math>3<\/math> for <math>c+d \\ge 10<\/math>. Thus, the right-hand side is <math>32<\/math> for <math>c+d \\le 9<\/math> and <math>35<\/math> for <math>c+d \\ge 10<\/math>. We can solve these two scenarios as systems of equations\/inequalities:\n\n<math>4c+d = 32<\/math>\n\n<math>c+d \\le 9<\/math>\n\nand\n\n<math>4c+d=35<\/math>\n\n<math>c+d \\ge 10<\/math>\n\nSolving yields three pairs <math>(c, d):<\/math> <math>(8, 0)<\/math>; <math>(8, 3)<\/math>; and <math>(7, 7)<\/math>. Checking the numbers <math>1980<\/math>, <math>1983<\/math>, and <math>1977<\/math>; we find that all three work.

Next, there are <math>12<\/math> spacy subsets with <math>1<\/math> element in them, one for each integer <math>1<\/math> through <math>12<\/math>.\n\nNow, let us consider the spacy subsets with <math>2<\/math> elements in them.

First, start off by representing each element of the chosen subset with a <math>1<\/math>, and every other element <math>0<\/math>. The possible states are as follows; if the restriction was broken previously or not. For the sake of not over counting, we let the former be its own state (call it \"C\"), and the latter will be split up into more states. The previous two digits can either be <math>00<\/math>, <math>10<\/math>, or <math>01<\/math>. If a previous digit doesn't exist, it is <math>0<\/math> for obvious reasons. We know that we start off at state \"<math>00<\/math>\". We have two options; include the first digit (<math>1<\/math>) or not (<math>0<\/math>). Thus, state <math>00<\/math> transitions to state <math>01<\/math> in <math>1<\/math> case and state <math>00<\/math> in <math>1<\/math> case. State <math>01<\/math> transitions to <math>10<\/math> in <math>1<\/math> case and the \"C\" state in <math>1<\/math> case. State <math>10<\/math> transitions to <math>00<\/math> in <math>1<\/math> case and state \"C\" in <math>1<\/math> case. Since it doesn't matter where or how many times the restriction is broken for the subset to fail, state \"C\" can transition to itself in <math>2<\/math> cases. \n\nNotice how this corresponds to a transition matrix of \n<math>\\begin{bmatrix} \n\t1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n\t0 & 0 & 1 & 1\\\\\n\t1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n        0 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}<\/math>.

Specifically, we observe that terms cancel when <math>1 \\equiv b+c\\text{ (mod }2\\text{)}<\/math> because every unique term is of the form:\n<cmath>\\binom{k}{a,b,c}x^ay^bz^c+(-1)^{b+c}\\binom{k}{a,b,c}x^ay^bz^c<\/cmath>\nfor all possible <math>a,b,c<\/math>.\n\n\nSince the generating function for the maximum number of unique terms is already known, it is logical that we want to find the generating function for the number of terms that cancel, also in terms of <math>k<\/math>.

Thus <math>b+c<\/math> is also even or both <math>b<\/math> and <math>c<\/math> are odd or both <math>b<\/math> and <math>c<\/math> are even. This case clearly fails the above criteria and there are 0 possible solutions.\n\nCase 2:    <math>a<\/math> is odd\n\nNow we know that <math>a<\/math> is odd and <math>a+b+c=2006<\/math>. Thus <math>b+c<\/math> is odd and <math>b<\/math> is odd and <math>c<\/math> is even or <math>b<\/math> is even and <math>c<\/math> is odd. All terms that have <math>a<\/math> being odd work.\n\nWe now need to figure out how many of the terms have <math>a<\/math> as a odd number. We know that <math>a<\/math> can be equal to any number between 0 and 2006. There are 1003 odd numbers between this range and 2007 total numbers.

After <math>s<\/math> elements are chosen, we will have skipped <math>s-1<\/math> elements (these are the elements that were \"eliminated\" as they were consecutive).

So <math>a_i | 999<\/math> and <math>a_i | a_2<\/math>, so <math>a_i | \\gcd(999, a_2) = 1<\/math>, so <math>a_i = 1<\/math>. For the proof of the second result, note that if <math>a_i = 0<\/math>, then <math>a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 2}<\/math>, so by the first result we just proved, <math>a_{i - 2} = a_{i - 1} = 1<\/math>.\n----------------------\n\n'''Lemma:''' <math>(a_n)<\/math> completes at <math>i<\/math> for some <math>i \\leq 2000<\/math>.\n\n'''Proof:''' Suppose <math>(a_n)<\/math> completed at some <math>i > 2000<\/math> or not at all. Then by the second lemma and the fact that neither <math>999<\/math> nor <math>a_2<\/math> are <math>0<\/math>, none of the pairs <math>(a_1, a_2), ..., (a_{1999}, a_{2000})<\/math> can have a <math>0<\/math> or be equal to <math>(1, 1)<\/math>. So the first lemma implies\n<cmath>\\max(a_1, a_2) > \\max(a_3, a_4) > \\cdots > \\max(a_{1999}, a_{2000})  > 0,<\/cmath>\nso <math>999 = \\max(a_1, a_2) \\geq 1000<\/math>, a contradiction.

Hence, there are <math>2 \\times 2 \\times 2=8<\/math> ways the ants can move to different points.\n\n*Case 2: Ant from point <math>F<\/math> moved to point <math>D<\/math>\nOn the plane, points <math>B<\/math> and <math>D<\/math> are taken.

Since an ant cannot stay still, <math>f(1) = 0<\/math>. We also easily see that <math>f(2) = 1, f(3) = 2<\/math>. \n\nNow consider any four vertices of the octahedron. All four vertices will be connected by edges except for one pair. Let\u2019s think of this as a [[square]] with one diagonal (from top left to bottom right).

Thus none of the ants can navigate the diagonal and can either shift clockwise or counterclockwise, and so <math>f(4) = 2<\/math>.\n\nFor <math>f(6)<\/math>, consider an ant at the top of the octahedron. It has four choices. Afterwards, it can either travel directly to the bottom, and then it has <math>2<\/math> ways back up, or it can travel along the sides and then go to the bottom, of which simple counting gives us <math>6<\/math> ways back up. Hence, this totals <math>4 \\times (2+6) = 32<\/math>.\n\nNow, the number of possible ways is given by the sum of all possible cycles,\n<cmath>a \\cdot f(2) \\cdot f(2) \\cdot f(2) + b \\cdot f(2) \\cdot f(4) + c \\cdot f(3) \\cdot f(3) + d \\cdot f(6)<\/cmath>\n\nwhere the [[coefficient]]s represent the number of ways we can configure these cycles. To find <math>a<\/math>, fix any face, there are <math>4<\/math> adjacent faces to select from to complete the cycle. From the four remaining faces there are only <math>2<\/math> ways to create cycles, hence <math>a = 8<\/math>.\n\nTo find <math>b<\/math>, each cycle of <math>2<\/math> faces is distinguished by their common edge, and there are <math>12<\/math> edges, so <math>b = 12<\/math>.\n\nTo find <math>c<\/math>, each three-cycle is distinguished by the vertex, and there are <math>8<\/math> edges.

Because the first step must be from the top to the middle square ring, we choose one vertex to move to and will multiply the final result by four.\n\nWe divide the paths into two sub-cases.\n\nSub-case 1: The ant continues to the bottom vertex.  In this case, the ant has visited three corners of a square, but can not next visit the fourth corner or there will be no way to connect the remaining two vertices of the octahedron.  Thus, the ant must next visit one of the other two vertices, and that selection decides the remainder of the path.  Thus, this sub-case has 2 possible paths.\n\nSub-case 2: The ant continues along the \"equator\" square ring. By symmetry, there are two choices.  Choose one, and we will multiply the final result by two.  From that second point on the equator, there are two choices.  If it continues to a third point on the equator, there is only one path to complete the cycle.  If it next moves to the bottom vertex, there are two ways to complete the cycle. This gives a total of three possible paths.  Multiplying by 2 gives 6 for this sub-case.\n\nThere are <math>(2 + 6) \\cdot 4 = 32<\/math> ways here. \n\nOverall, there are <math>80<\/math> cases.

The square root of a positive number is a positive number, and the square root of a negative or complex number will yield a complex number. Complex numbers are a bit harder to address than real numbers, so I won't go into depth on complex domain\/range (You don't need to, as this is a 2003 question, and the test writers most likely did not intend for test takers to take complex numbers into consideration. Also, even without considering complex domain\/range, we can still get the answer).\n\nSince the range cannot include negative numbers, the domain must be the same. This means that the graph of <math>f(x)<\/math> must only exist in the real coordinate plane for non-negative x-values. If any negative value of x yields a positive value under the square root, then <math>f(x)<\/math> will be positive, and then a negative x-value will be part the domain, and that contradicts what the first thing that we found. Now, first consider the graph of a quadratic equation\/parabola. We know that a parabola always has a vertex, and always extends until <math>+<\/math> or <math>-<\/math> infinity, depending on the <math>a<\/math> value. Quite conveniently, we have an <math>a<\/math> value in the problem.\n\nConsider the case where <math>a<\/math> is positive. Then, the parabola will \"start\" at the vertex, and extend upwards, hitting the x-axis at any roots. The y-values of a \"positive\" parabola are <math>[\\infty, 0]<\/math> between x-values of <math>-\\infty<\/math> and <math>r_1<\/math> (the leftmost root), negative between <math>r_1<\/math> and <math>r_2<\/math> (the two roots) and <math>[0, \\infty]<\/math> between <math>r_2<\/math> and <math>\\infty<\/math>. If we take the square root of such a parabola, the new function will exist only from <math>x=[-\\infty, r_1]<\/math> and <math>x=[r_2, \\infty]<\/math>. In order words, if <math>a<\/math> is positive, the graph of <math>f(x)<\/math> will exist from <math>-\\infty<\/math> to <math>\\infty<\/math> except between the two roots. This means, that regardless of where the roots are, some negative value of <math>x<\/math> will yield a positive value of <math>f(x)<\/math>. This means a positive value of <math>a<\/math> will not work.\n\nNow we consider the case where <math>a<\/math> is negative. The parabola will do the opposite of the above; i.e. extend downwards. Now, either the entire graph of the parabola is below the x-axis (no roots), or some part including the vertex sticks out above it. The graph of the square root of the parabola will either be non-existent, or exist only between the 2 roots, respectively. This could work, as long as both roots are at least 0 (this way we will not have negative x-values in the domain). \n\nUpon examination, we find that <math>ax^2+bx<\/math> can be rewritten <math>x(ax+b)<\/math>.

The y-coordinate of the vertex is then <math>-\\frac{b^2}{4a}<\/math>. We want the square root of this, so the range of <math>f(x)<\/math> is <math>\\left[0, \\sqrt{-\\frac{b^2}{4a}}\\right]<\/math>. Since domain and range must be equivalent, we have <math>\\frac{b}{-a} = \\sqrt{\\frac{b^2}{-4a}} \\Rightarrow \\frac{b}{-a} = \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{-4a}} \\Rightarrow -a = \\sqrt{-4a} \\Rightarrow a^2 = -4a \\Rightarrow a^2 + 4a = 0 \\Rightarrow a(a+4) = 0<\/math>.

Clearly this is not accounted for if you put on 8 socks right away and then 8 shoes. You don't have to put on 8 socks and then 8 shoes.

We know that the two real solutions are integers and that the final product is an integer. The product of the real solutions multiplied by the product of the complex solutions equals the final product, so we know that the product of the two complex solutions must be integers. We know the two complex solutions are conjugates, so we can test all the answer choices and find that A is the answer. ~A1597412\n\nNote: No, the solution is not correct.

The product of all four roots is <math>2<\/math>, which is clearly an integer.\n\nFINAL CLARIFICATION: The note above is accurate. This solution is not fully complete in writing, but is valid nonetheless. If the 2 complex roots multiply to a non-integer, the sum of all 4 roots MAY STILL produce an integer. However, if the 2 complex roots multiply to an integer, all 4 roots MUST produce an integer.

We can then use the quadratic formula to solve for these complex roots.\n\nLet's start by using synthetic division to divide <math>x^4+ax^3+bx^2+cx+d<\/math> by <math>(x-p)<\/math>. Using this method, the quotient becomes <math>1x^3+(a-p)x^2+(b-pa+p^2)x+(c-bp+ap^2-p^3)+\\frac{d-pc+bp^2-ap^3+p^4}{x-q}<\/math>. However, we know that there should be no remainder because <math>(x-p)<\/math> is a factor of the polynomial, so <math>\\frac{d-pc+bp^2-ap^3+p^4}{x-q}<\/math> must equal 0, so <math>d=-pc+bp^2-ap^3+p^4<\/math>. When we divide the expression on the left by -p, we get <math>c-bp+ap^2-p^3<\/math>, so we can replace it in our original synthetic division equation with <math>\\frac {d}{-k}<\/math>.\n\nWe then want to synthetically divide <math>x^3+(a-p)x^2+(b-pa+p^2)x+\\frac {d}{-k}<\/math> by the next factor, <math>(x-q)<\/math>. Using the same method as before, we can simplify the quotient to <math>x^2+(a-p-q)x+\\frac{d}{pq}<\/math>.

Furthermore, by Vieta's Formulas, we know that d must be a multiple of p and q, so <math>\\frac{4d}{pq}<\/math> is a multiple of 4. Rearranging the expression, we get:\n\n<math>\\frac{1+i\\sqrt{\\frac{4d}{pq}-1}}{2}<\/math>\n\nThe radicand therefore must be one less than a multiple of four, which is only the case in <math>\\frac {1 + i \\sqrt {11}}{2}<\/math> or <math>\\boxed{A}<\/math>.\n","The problem states that the function is a quartic, and there are already two roots given.
